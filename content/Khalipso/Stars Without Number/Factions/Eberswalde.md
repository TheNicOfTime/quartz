The intelligence service of the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. 

## Crimson Tide

A front organization for Eberswalde. This is the organization that gives [[Alexander De Leon]] his missions. 

### Assassination of [[Sven Tavzitro]]

Wanted to kill off [[Sven Tavzitro]] without a trial, as they knew he was part of the [[The Church of Eloritu]] as an agent. Hired [[Alexander De Leon]] to do it. Will pay him 2000 credits for the job. 

### Message to [[Alexander De Leon]]

Alexander will hear a knock late one night a couple days after arriving on [[Terminus]]. This will be a message from [[Eberswalde]], styled as it was from the Crimson Tide. It will be in a cypher that Alexander knows. They want him to assassinate [[Lero Bek]], Minister of the Magitech Industry for the [[The Poleus Bloc]]. The message reads:

Alexander will hear a knock late one night a couple days after arriving on [[Terminus]]. This will be a message from [[Eberswalde]], styled as it was from the Crimson Tide. It will be in a cypher that Alexander knows, and inside he will find 1500 credits. The message reads:

Congratulations on completing your assignment, Distant Whisper. You shall find your payment included in this message. Your next target is [[Lero Bek]], an important figure in the Ministry of the Magitech Industry for the Poleus Bloc. Lero is a top administrator and negotiator who has risen to prominence precipitously, striking several important deals with planets securing access to the natural resources supplying the Bloc's booming Magitech industry. He has also reformed several of the industrial plants producing this Magitech, increasing efficiency by 10% while raising wages and benefits. He is well beloved in the Bloc, and poised to become a powerful political figure. However, we have reason to believe he has ulterior motives and has an aggressive stance towards the Federation, and if he were to come to power would jeopardize aspects of Federation Magitech industry. 

Unfortunately, we have precious little information on his personal life. What we do know is this: his home planet is Thucala, and we have reason to believe he is working with the smuggling ring [[Fyre Syndicate]]. He is apparently attending frequent clandestine meetings with the Syndicate leaders, however we do not know the nature of what is being discussed. Your assignment is to investigate Lero Bek and his connections, find him and eliminate him. Your payment will be 10,0000 credits, paid out upon confirmed death of Lero Bek.
