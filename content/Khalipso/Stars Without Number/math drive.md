These are ancient artifacts only found in this sector, and only recently discovered (~100 years ago) that they can be used to produce efficient energy. The only thing known about how they work is that they perform a lot of complex operations on math problems no one understands and are given patterns that it then turns into complete noise, impossible to return to the pattern, and this produces energy.

[[Bosch]]'s theory about how they work is that they are entropy accelerators that work on information first.
