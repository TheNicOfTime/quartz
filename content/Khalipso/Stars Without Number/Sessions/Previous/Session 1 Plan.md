# Introduction
```
All PCs start off imprisoned at the [[Eberswalde Deep Well]], the FUD's maximum security prison situated around a black hole. The most dangerous criminals of the Federation are sent here, however other prisoners are sent here as well for various reasons, including political prisoners and any other criminals being sent by judges with harsh sentences. 
```

### **Intro Dialogue:** 
Welcome, everyone, to the campaign! We are playing in the Stars without number universe mostly, so I'll give a brief introduction and backstory. Hundreds of years ago, most of the galaxy was connected through metadimensional travel, either through the use of science like spike drives and Jump Gates, or through magical means that are too numerous to count but usually much more volatile. One day, a massive wave of metadimensional energy ripped through the entirety of the galaxy, completely destroying spike drives, jump gates, and any psychics currently connected to the warp. This event, later called "the Scream", was followed by a period of disconnection, scientific atrophy, and loss of communication as the Warp and all other dimensions became inaccessible for close to 600 years. Gradually, all these disconnected planets have begun taking to the stars again in the hopes of regaining the glory of the pre-scream stellar empires. 

You all are in the the Kalipso sector! A large chunk of connected space still expanding, connecting, and exploring all of the worlds within its reach. It is currently embroiled in a decades long power struggle between two interstellar superpowers, the Federation of United Planets and the Poleus Bloc. For 60 years, these two superpowers have been been vying for galactic supremacy through espionage, research, and proxy wars.  
	
However, none of you probably care much about all of that right now. You all are currently on a prison transport craft, being shuttled from whatever local jailhouse on whatever local planet to you were previously on after being picked up one by one as the ship makes its circuitous journey. One of the guards traveling with you has informed you that you all are lucky enough to be guests at the Shard, and then walked off with obviously forced laughter. You all, however, are just overflow from around the Federation, and the Shard apparently has plenty of extra room.

You are seated across from each other in a holding cell inside the shuttle. Hands cuffed in front of you, feet bound in shackles, and those with magical powers have collars around your necks that are dampening your powers (DC to escape from manacles is 30, DC to break them is 25). You are also harnessed to the seats as the shuttle makes its departure from the planet and prepartions for a spike drive to the shard. There are 3 other prisoners in here with you all, a scrawny looking Vesk ([[Julius]]) sitting between [[Qusari]] and [[Demitra DeMarco]] and another two flanking [[Lutri]].  The ship is currently taking off from its last stop picking up one more prisoner, a small green and red hobgoblin the guards took somewhere else. 

Everyone is silent except the scrawny vesk [[Julius]] (The Vesk next to [[Qusari]] and [[Demitra DeMarco]]) who has been muttering under his breath ever since he joined your merry band in a wiry snivvly accent: "I shouldn't be here, I didn't do anything! I'm not a criminal!" and is generally freaking out.

So, let's go around and introduce the characters, what they look like and what kinda vibes you putting out there. 

Velloro decides to speak up if none of them do and ask what put them in the slammer. He got busted for fighting in an illegal gladiator battle on his home planet of Fra. 

# Play part 1: Transport Ship

You feel the telltale shudder and slight pickling of skin as the ships spike drive forces the ship into metadimensional space, starting the final leg of the journey. A couple seconds later, the harnesses are released and you are free to stand up and walk about.

The journey is going to take about ~1 hour, they have an hour to do stuff on the ship before they arrive at the Shard. (This will be about an hour of real time as well as in-game time.) With the cuffs on, you have the Entangled condition (You move at half speed, you cannot run or charge, and you take a –2 penalty to your AC, attack rolls, Reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks.)

**5 or 4 CR (XP budget of 1,600 or 1,200)**

Want to make it possible but extremely unlikely that they could break out completely right here, but likely enough that they will get out of the holding cell to overhear a conversation that will be useful in breaking out of the prison later. 

When they leave the room: The rest of the ship is much the same as the room you were just in, extremely sparse and obviously outfitted for one job: transporting prisoners. There are four guards about, most looking extremely bored with one even sleeping in his chair and none take notice of you as you exit. You hear a whispering from down the left hallway.

[[Boomerang]] is on this ship with them, being held in another area because he is considered higher risk due to being from the [[Terminus]] gang (Eos Fortuna). If they encounter him here he will tell them he knows someone on the inside who can get them an emp grenade to help break out if they help him out.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

Lay of the Land (Ex)

A guard officer can alert other creatures to local customs, traditions, tricks, and suspicious activity, granting a +2 bonus for 24 hours on opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks within the guard officer’s home area (typically a city, large spaceship, or space station). She can also arrange a meeting with a watch captain.

Guard officer: Actually knows what's going on and is somber about it. Was at the Shard before, got out and now is being transferred back. Will let the players into the cargo hold if they can defeat the Akata. Will give them:
- 2 tactical batons 
- 3 survival knife
- 1 assault hammer
- 2 azimuth laser pistol
- 1 flame pistol
Velloro will fight with them.

#### Parts of the ship
- Cargo hold: Where the PCs start, there is an airlock at the back, seats to strap into, and not much else. leads to the rest of the bottom of the ship. The door is locked currently and very hard to open, but the guard outside will let them out without much pushing
- 1 guard outside the hold 
- A separate hold with a laser door they cannot open that houses [[Boomerang]]
- Top part of the ship has a main hull section with not much in it. 
- Back of the ship contains the engine room with the spike drive. It is flooded with metadimensional energies as it propels the ship through the Warp. There are two blast doors (Airlock doors, 4 inch thick, hardiness 35, hit points 160, break DC 40) that can't be opened to it. Opening it would flood the ship with the metadimension, killing everyone instantly and destroying the ship.
- The front is the cockpit, blocked off by those same blast doors.
- The left room is a storage room with supplies for the prison. There is a lower security locked door to it. 
		- Locked door has a computer to access and open it. The base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier (so 17 for this one). The computer has a level 1 shock grid countermeasure. Saving DC: 20, Damage: 8D6 (XP: 400)
			- The computer and its surrounding environment are protected by a grid of conductive material that transmits a shock to anyone who fails to access the system. This has two settings: one meant to stun and one meant to kill. Normally, the stun setting happens first, with a warning about lethal force should the intruder make another attempt. The stun setting forces all creatures within 10 feet of the terminal to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The lethal setting affects nearby creatures like the stun setting but also deals electricity damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the computer, allowing a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC, damage dealt, and price all depend upon the rank of the shock grid, as indicated on Table 7–25: Shock Grids. Each rank added counts as one countermeasure when determining the total number of countermeasures a system can have. Only computers fixed permanently to a floor or similar surface can have shock grids. 
	- Unlocked boxes have food supplies in them
	- In the locked storage boxes they can find (Perception roll for searching/Computer Hack system/Strength check to break them open): 
		- DC 10: 
			- 3 batons
			-  5 flare guns
			-  3 Estex suits 
			- 2 medpatches 
			- 2 manacles
			-  2 personal comm units
		- DC 15: 2 survival knives,  and 2 azimuth lazer pistol for weapons. 8 Estex suits. 500 meters Cable line, titanium alloy. 4 Medpatches. 2 Flashlights. 10 Manacles. 10 Personal Comm units
		- DC 18: 1 Lashunta ringwear I, 1 azimuth laser rifle, 1 standard Taclash, 2 Basic Medkit, 1 gulchgun, Reaction cannon, light, NIL grenade launcher, merc
		- DC 23: 1 thinplate, 1 Kasatha microcord I, 1 tactical crossbolter, 1 Incendiary grenade I, 1 Flamethrower, ifrit-class
- The right room contains two monsters being transported to the prison. The guards will make a deal with the players to show that they can become important in the prison and allow them access to supplies and not cavity search them if they beat these monsters (2 Akata, CR 2).
	- (2) Akata: This hairless blue lion has twin tentacular tails. Dozens more thick tentacles quiver and twitch where its mane should be. Terrifying predators that live in space. Its face is two glowing eyes that constantly change color and a large jawed maw. 
		- XP: 400 each
		- During Combat Akatas seek to infect as many foes as possible with their parasitic bite.
		- Morale Akatas fight until destroyed.

ABOUT

Guard officers supervise guards in their duties and respond to major disturbances, using their grim demeanors and skill at arms to quell conflict. They coordinate well in battle with the guards under their command, rounding up troublemakers and preventing their escape.

# Play Part 2: The Shard Escape

### **Description of the prison**

The Shard is an old installation, a space station that has been in orbit around a black hole for longer than the Federation has existed. The station itself consists of a humungous black obelisk, seemingly made out of a shard of rock rather than metal. Eight rectangular spokes jut out near the center of the obelisk, forming part of a more conventional space station structure ringing the center. A ring surrounds and connects the ends of the cell blocks, and you see the dock you are coming in to land on as you approach.

- *Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Culture or Physical Science):* 
	- DC: 18
	- If they fail: they only know it looks like it isn't being used for its initial purpose and is very old. Maybe Mandate tech? The central shard of the station looks like it is carved from a black glassy rock, not metal or any traditional space building materials.
	- If they pass: This is older than the first new space faring civilization known in the Kalipso sector, but doesn't look like Mandate tech. It looks foreign, made by no civilization you are aware of. The black rock seems to shift constantly as if it were a liquid while retaining its shape, it looks like nothing you have ever seen before and gives off an ominous vibe.

When they arrive, [[Boomerang]] tells them to meet him in the mess hall as soon as they can. He gives them the EMP and tells them about the gangs. He also mentions that his previous crew were planning to break someone out of here, someone with the codename "[[Bosch]]".

## The Gangs of the Shard

There are two major factions of prisoners inside the Shard. The first group are those who are associated with the Poleus Bloc, generally political prisoners or people who hail from Bloc planets. The other factions consists of most everyone else, terrorists, prisoners, gang members, and anyone imprisoned with no connection to the Bloc. 

### The Six Runes

- *Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Culture or Religion):* 
	- DC: 13
	- If they pass: They know that the name of this gang probably comes from the state religion of the Poleus Bloc, which worships the god Eloritu. A god of mysteries and magic, as well as technology and mysticism, his main symbol is the magical six runes. 

This gang is headed by a mystic priest named [[Sven Tavzitro]], an enigmatic priest who is basically at war with the guards of the prison, trying to break out and take over the prison. Working with them Sven will send them to the storage wing to sneak in and get a crate for them. Doing so will allow The Six Runes to attempt a riot, and distract the guards for the escape plan. They also know that several Poleus Bloc political prisoners, specifically scientists, have mysteriously disappeared from the prison and they would appreciate any info the players find on them. 

### The other gang

Doesn't have a name, has a working relationship with the guards to try to prevent the escape of the Six Runes in exchange for entertainment (The Fight pit), drugs, food, and other things. When they go to try to get help from this gang,  they will have to prove their worth by fighting in the fight pit. Headed by a human outlaw named [[Kolt]]. Getting in good with them they will lure the guards out to the fight pit where they will let you and might help you get keycard access to the Shard in the center of the prison. 

## The fight pit (CR 3 or 4, XP 800-1,200)

Flayer leech (CR 4 XP 1,200) or an Early Stage Barath (CR 2 XP 600) and an assembly ooze (CR 1 XP 400)

## The Storage wing

There is a trap once they enter the storage wing: CR 1 XP 400 (Laser blast trap, if they trip the sensors near the front of the room a laser turret will pop down and shoot them)
![[Pasted image 20220402181010.png]]

Once they deal with the trap they find an old room filled with a bunch of useless electronics and long-term storage. The only useful thing is the crate, they will have to make a Perception Search (DC 15) check to find it in time.  There is also a disused emergency airlock in here. 

# The math drive

Once they make it into the room, they can see the Shard up close. A swirling mass of black that seems to suck in all light from the surroundings while simultaneously appearing shiny like obsidian, you can't quite look at it directly. Whenever you do, your seem to avert your gaze without meaning to. 

There are a couple of Poleus Bloc scientists in here researching the Shard against their will, as the Bloc has the formost scientists on math drive tech. One of them is 

- Wisdom saving through to see more of it (DC 15)
	- Pass: You are able to concentrate on the obelisk and notice the swirling is actually in the form of numbers and mathematical formulas shifting and solving themselves over and over again across the surface of the rock. 
- *Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Physical Science):* 
	- DC: 17
	- If they pass: This is a humungous math drive, larger than any you have heard about before, and there aren't many in the known galaxy. These drives are the central pieces in the ongoing sector wide cold war, and the Federation appears to have one substantially bigger than the Bloc by the looks of it. The control panel near by also appears to be esoteric tech, not made by the Federation, and seems to be regulating the absolutely massive power this shard must be putting out. 

When they set off the EMP, the station goes pitch black for a second and they can hear the battle start between the Six Symbols and the Guards. When the emergency lights come on, they can see that the Obelisk is swirling much faster now and a faint red glow is starting to come off of it, and it is getting more intense every moment. When they run down the hallway to the space dock, a guard they won't notice will pass them. 

- **Perception check: DC: 15**
	- Pass: they notice the guard, but where their face should be you see the same swirling blackness and numbers from the math drive. The next second they are gone.

They run into the guards at the end of the hallway if they have enough health, with some other prisoners to help (and [[Boomerang]]). After that battle they run to the dock and [[Boomerang]] directs him to his impounded ship. We will make the ship in the next session. They fly out of the station and punch the spike drive. As they fly away, they see a couple other starcraft taking off from the station as the red glow from the Shard becomes blinding for a moment before spikes jut out at every angle from it, piercing the station in dozens of locations and rending metal apart, before the Shard blinks out of existence leaving a broken ring of a space station behind.

# End

When they get off of the station, it'll be a surprise that a month has gone by in the rest of the galaxy because they were too close to a black hole.
