## Introduction
```
All PCs start off imprisoned at the [[Eberswalde Deep Well]], the FUD's maximum security prison situated around a black hole. The most dangerous criminals of the Federation are sent here, however other prisoners are sent here as well for various reasons, including political prisoners and any other criminals being sent by judges with harsh sentences. 
```

### **Intro Dialogue:** 
Welcome, everyone, to the campaign! We are playing in the Stars without number universe mostly, so I'll give a brief introduction and backstory. Hundreds of years ago, most of the galaxy was connected through metadimensional travel, either through the use of science like spike drives and Jump Gates, or through magical means that are too numerous to count but usually much more volatile. One day, a massive wave of metadimensional energy ripped through the entirety of the galaxy, completely destroying spike drives, jump gates, and any psychics currently connected to the warp. This event, later called "the Scream", was followed by a period of disconnection, scientific atrophy, and loss of communication as the Warp and all other dimensions became inaccessible for close to 600 years. Gradually, all these disconnected planets have begun taking to the stars again in the hopes of regaining the glory of the pre-scream stellar empires. 

You all are in the the Kalipso sector! A large chunk of connected space still expanding, connecting, and exploring all of the worlds within its reach. It is currently embroiled in a decades long power struggle between two interstellar superpowers, the Federation of United Planets and the Poleus Bloc. For 60 years, these two superpowers have been been vying for galactic supremacy through espionage, research, and proxy wars.  
	
However, none of you probably care much about all of that right now. You all are currently on a prison transport craft, being shuttled from whatever local jailhouse on whatever local planet to you were previously on after being picked up one by one as the ship makes its circuitous journey. One of the guards traveling with you on this journey has informed you that you (5/6) are lucky enough to be guests at the Shard, something most of you probably haven't heard of before. You all, however, are just overflow from around the Federation, and the Shard apparently has plenty of extra room.

You (5/6) are seated across from each other in the back of the shuttle. Hands cuffed in front of you, feet bound in shackles, and those with magical powers have collars around your necks that are dampening your powers. There is one other prisoner in here with you all, a scrawny looking Vesk ([[Julius]]) sitting next you [[Amos]]. The back of the shuttle is an airlock, towards the from is a locked door that presumably leads to the rest of the ship and the cockpit. There was another prisoner, a small green and red hobgoblin that was the last stop the shuttle did before making towards your new home, but the guards took him deeper into the ship leaving you inmates here by yourselves. 

So, let's go around and introduce the characters, what they look like and what kinda vibes you putting out there. 

# Play part 1

The journey is going to take about ~1 hour, they have an hour to do stuff on the ship before they arrive at the Shard. (This will be about an hour of real time as well as in-game time.) With the cuffs on, you have the Entangled condition (You move at half speed, you cannot run or charge, and you take a –2 penalty to your AC, attack rolls, Reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks.)

[[Julius]] in a wiry snivvly accent: "I shouldn't be here, I didn't do anything! I shouldn't be locked up with these CRIMINALS! I'm just a data analyst!" and is generally freaking out. At some point he asks why they are all here.

**5 or 4 CR (XP budget of 1,600 or 1,200)**

Want to make it possible but extremely unlikely that they could break out completely right here, but likely enough that they will get out of the holding cell to overhear a conversation that will be useful in breaking out of the prison later. 

[[Boomerang]] is on this ship with them, being held in another area because he is considered higher risk due to being from the [[Terminus]] gang. If they encounter him here he will tell them he knows someone on the inside who can get them an emp grenade to help break out if they help him out.

##### Locations
1 in the lower deck guarding  [[Boomerang]]
2 in the upper decks playing cards and smoking

Lower deck guard is somewhat dimwitted and is very excited to be going to work at an "important place", takes his duties very seriously.

Upper deck guards are somber because they know they are never coming back from this, and this is the most dead-end of dead-end jobs. 

#### Parts of the ship
- Cargo hold: Where the PCs start, there is an airlock at the back, seats to strap into, and not much else. leads to the rest of the bottom of the ship. The door is locked currently and very hard to open, but the guard outside will let them out without much pushing
- 1 guard outside the hold 
- A separate hold with a laser door they cannot open that houses [[Boomerang]]
- A break room for the guards with some food and two tables and stools.
- Ladders up to the top part of the ship with hatches on the top of them. 
- Top part of the ship has a main hull section with not much in it. 
- Back of the ship contains the engine room with the spike drive. It is flooded with metadimensional energies as it propels the ship through the Warp. There are two blast doors that can't be opened to it. Opening it would flood the ship with the metadimension, killing everyone instantly and destroying the ship.
- The front is the cockpit, blocked off by those same blast doors.
- The left room is a storage room with supplies for the prison. There is a lower security locked door to it. 
	- Unlocked boxes have food supplies in them
	- In the locked storage boxes they can find: 3 batons, 2 survival knives, 5 flare guns, and an azimuth lazer pistol for weapons. 8 Estex suits. 500 meters Cable line, titanium alloy. 4 Medpatches. 2 Flashlights. 10 Manacles. 10 Personal Comm units.

ABOUT

Guard officers supervise guards in their duties and respond to major disturbances, using their grim demeanors and skill at arms to quell conflict. They coordinate well in battle with the guards under their command, rounding up troublemakers and preventing their escape.



**If they listen in to the officers in the cockpit, they will hear this discussion with the station:**

"Well how long is this going to take? Yes I know we need to do it, but its going to leave a hole in security the size of gas giant. If someone knocks out the power from the lower decks while you all are retrofitting the electrical systems, its all kapoot. Yes I know its been decided in ... You'll get it done in a day? Fine. Two weeks from now." and he stops the com call. 

### **Description of the prison**
The prison is an old installation, a space station that has been in orbit around the EHGF524074 black hole for longer than the Federation has been around. It could be Mandate tech, however no one really knows. The station itself is a large spike with eight rectangular projections consisting of the prison cells jutting out perpendicular from the center of the spike. A ring surrounds and connects the ends of the cell blocks, and houses all of the guards and administration. The center spike has an upper section, which contains the shipyard where the incoming and outgoing prisoners come through, as well as an impound for the starships from the various prisoners. The very peak of this spike is the warden's office. The lower half of the spike is only reachable through a central elevator, and is the most well guarded part of the prison. You do not know what is down there, but you assume it is where the worst prisoners are kept. 

### **Intro for the breakout:**
For the past few weeks, you all have banded together to plan a prison break. Currently, you all are gathering in the mess hall to meet up with [[Boomerang]], another inmate, to negotiate for the last piece of the puzzle for your escape plan: an emp grenade smuggled in through various channels you are too low ranking to understand. You see him sitting along at a table, picking at some slop. He notices you all and waves you over.

```
Ask the players who they are and what they look like as they talk to him. This is the first time they're talking to him, and he wants introductions to all of them. 
Conversation with Boomerang: He wants to be taken with the players. He won't give the emp willingly unless they agree to take him, and even if they don't he will end up stowing away on their ship in the chaos.
```

After obtaining the last key component in your plan, you set off to enact your daring escape, and we fade into a flashback of how we got to this point. 



## The Plan
```
After they get the emp from [[Boomerang]], they can now execute the plan. Coming up with the plan can be done in a series of flashbacks.
```

After a couple minutes, you all hear from the starport side of the door a large crashing sound, followed by shouts of alarm, followed by a loud whining sound of an impulse drive spinning up and an explosion. The guard by the door shouts in "Damn it what was that. Looks like you all will have to stay in this holding cell a while" and rushes off towards the crash. You are again left alone, this time with no one to hear you. 

`They can find a grating that they can remove and crawl through a vent a couple of meters to above the office of the chief of the guards. At the end of the vent shaft, there are metal bars installed they can't get past.`

Once in the shaft you hear the chief of staff talking on comms to someone "Well how long is this going to take? Yes I know we need to do it, but its going to leave a hole in our security the size of gas giant. If someone knocks out the power from the lower decks while you all are retrofitting the electrical systems, its all kapoot. The cells open, all doors unlock, and the automatic defense systems deactivate. All we would have left is the guards, and we're understaffed as it is. Yes I know its been decided in ... You'll get it done in a day? Fine. Two weeks from now." and he trails off as you hear noises from the holding cell. `Make a save to get back in time before the guards get back. If they fail, there is a consequence later on.`

## Flashback 2
```
Intro into the layout of the prison. This is much more freeform.
```

It's been about a week and you all are outside your cells in recreation time. You have all agreed to meet up and come up with a plan for how you will use the information you heard to escape. 

`Let them explore and find out what they want. Put an encounter with a fistfight here with another couple inmates.`

# End

When they get off of the station, it'll be a surprise that a year has gone by in the rest of the galaxy because they were too close to a black hole.
