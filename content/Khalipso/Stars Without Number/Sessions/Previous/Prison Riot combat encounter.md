The guards will clear out cell block A and form a perimeter to the door of the center room. [[Kolt]]'s gang will have 2 members dressed up as guards with them. Two of her gang will also hide near the entrance of cell block A, and cast holographic image to block the view of the guards at the entrance. They will be concentrating the whole time. 

Once the guards establish a perimeter, [[Kolt]]'s gang will attack (first with the two dressed as guards). During this combat, not everyone who is fighting will be in turn order. Once the PCs engage someone they will enter the turn order until it seems appropriate to remove them from the combat. During the initial stage if they move past [[Kolt]]'s men they won't attack, but moving past the guards will provoke attacks of opportunity. Kolt will also let out the two Crest-eaters from the fight pit to engage the guards, getting them to follow and fight them with bones and calcium bombs they made. 

After a round, [[Sven Tavzitro]] will enter the fray. [[Kolt]] will understand what is happening and order everyone to attack the PCs, and engaging with her lackeys will promote attacks now. 

The door to the central room will open in 2 rounds as the guards at the entrance will have a timing to let the guards in the prison in to allow the change in shift. There will be 6 rounds the door is open before it will close again. 

[[Kolt]], [[Sven Tavzitro]] will make for the door. Several of her lackeys and a couple guards will follow behind. 

[[Boomerang]] and [[Jean-Pierre]] will be there too.

[[Sven Tavzitro]] will immediately go for [[Bosch]].

They will both try and stop each other.
