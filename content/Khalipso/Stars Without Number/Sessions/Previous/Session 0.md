Intro into the world: 
- **This campaign takes place mostly in the Stars without Number universe. Humanity spread across the stars from Earth, finding many worlds to inhabit and many alien species to interact with. At some point, a psychic event called the Scream covered the entire galaxy, shutting down all space travel. Both spike drives, the technological method used by the majority, as well as magical/psychic methods of travel were completely prevented by the Scream. Only relatively recently, within the past 2-3 centuries, have sentient species rediscovered spike-drive technology and been able to conjur magic that allows travel between worlds. Travel has still been fairly tentative and slow, and small pockets of the galaxy have begun to interact with their stellar neighbors. Our campaign will take place in one relatively large sector of connected space, known to a slim majority of locals as the Kalipso sector. Two planets in this sector developed inter-system space travel around the same time, 300ish years ago, have been exploring and concentrating power for a considerable amount of time. These two planets, Thorhil and Poleus, have formed large superpowers in the sector and have fallen into a cold war with each other that dominates the political landscape of the sector. However, they have far from a firm grasp on most systems, with some planets in Kalipso not even aware of these planetary squabbles.**

Intro into the rules:
- **The vast majority of the rules for this campaign will come from Starfinder. All your character creation, progression, items, and general play rules will be from Starfinder. There are two exceptions; traveling between planets will use Stars without Number rules, and there will be a faction system that you all won't need to worry about at first from Stars without Number. The starships themselves, upgrading them, purchasing them, and the rules for starship combat will be from Starfinder. The faction system is something that if people are interested in interacting with it, I would like to have that become a part of what you do fairly early on, but if that doesn't interest you at all you don't ever have to interact with it.**
- **Character creation will come from Starfinder, which we can go through today if you want. I have posted all of the races and classes you can be in the rules chat, and you can go through them. Since this isn't the Starfinder rules, some of the background lore around the character creation might be different, but that'll have to be case-by-case. I would also discourage you from taking the wackiest races, such as the Contemplative, which is just a floating brain, but if you really want to we can try to work something out.**

First session
- **The first session will start out in a prison, with all the player characters being locked up by the Thorhil government for some reason, so if you want to be part of the first session try to think up some reason your character would be in prison. This doesn't have to be something they actually did wrong, but just got them locked up.**
