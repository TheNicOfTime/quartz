## Before session

Message John about the smuggler. Maybe set up a brief 1 on 1 session with him to do it.

- When he goes looking, he will find a smuggler from the [[Fyre Syndicate]], a bantrid named [[Scoots]]. When he goes searching first, he will learn that there is a Fyre Syndicate contact on [[Terminus]] but is not there currently. 

# Ideas

On [[Svallga]] the capital of the planet, Koblenz, contains the [[Svallga#Sanctum Bundesarchiv|Sanctum Bundesarchiv]], the records and archives for the entire [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. 

Ways they can get in potentially:

- Getting hired to do spelunking in the archives, make it up to the used layers of the archive and do something there
- Breaking in
- Any way they want, just make the whole thing. 

Three entrances into the Archives:
- Main public entrance
- [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] entrance for spelunking
- Maintenance hatch a local gang knows about

## Todo:
- [ ] Figure out music and sounds
- [ ] Set up maps
	- [ ] Archive map
	- [ ] Embassy Map
		- [ ] Guard patrols, traps and security
	- [ ] Street Map
	- [ ] Misc.
- [ ] Finalize [[The Last Resort]]
- [ ] Figure out what to do with [[Alexander De Leon]]'s stuff
- [ ] Set up encounters

# Start of session

Intro: <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">It has been a little longer than a week since you arrived on Terminus, and you have all recovered from the ordeal on the Shard. After letting Boomerang know yesterday that you all have decided to try and wipe your criminal status from the Federation's record, he told you all to meet him in the mess hall to go over the mission. This is where you find yourselves as you meet up one by one. Who arrives to the meeting first and who arrives last?</mark> 

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">The mess hall is a fairly spacious area with bench style seating that serves food to the denizens of Terminus who are in a rush, with a couple food stalls that are all mildly unappealing in different ways, but offer a lot of food for cheap. </mark> 

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Boomerang isn't here yet, but as the last of you arrive a short gnoll and a large Nuar approach with trays of food in hand.</mark> 

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Well what do we have here? Boomerang's newest crew huh? Man I pity you poor fools, you must've fucked up pretty to end up with him."</mark> 
- If pressed, he'll say: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Oh ho ho, you don't even know huh? About Boomerang's previous crews? He hasn't told you?"</mark> 
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"What number is this now Groq? 4? He's had three crews previously. All of them have ended up meeting unfortunate ends. Boomerang's cursed. I'd get out while you still can."</mark> 

They'll walk away and sit at a table out of earshot of the crew after this. [[Boomerang]] will come jogging up in a hurry with a large data pad in one hand. Short of breath, he'll say:

- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Sorry I'm late folks I pulled an all nighter getting shit together for this mission. One hell of an undertaking for yall right off the bat. You ready to get down to business?"</mark>
- If pressed about his previous crews: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"How'd you hear about that? Who told you? Look, its not like what it looks like. I've just had a string of bad luck that's all." </mark> 
- About the mission:
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"We will be entering the [[Svallga#Sanctum Bundesarchiv|Sanctum Bundesarchiv]], the federal archives for the Federation, and changing the record so we are no longer considered criminals. The easiest way would be to just erase our files, but that might cause some more problems down the line. Altering our files to remove the criminal record would be ideal, but more difficult."</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Getting into the Sanctum is its own can of worms. It is a massive structure built before the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] even existed, by the [[Terran Mandate]]. The majority of it sits underground. I've been able to find two main methods of entry: a small annex that serves as a library for the general public, and another. Apparently the archives are incompletely understood, the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] hires spelunkers to explorers to investigate the lower parts of the archive. Despite them going at this for years, progress seems incremental for some reason. That is all I think we're going to get for information until we get there and are able to work the case."</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"The Sanctum Bundesarchiv is located on [[Svallga]], homeworld of the Federation. To get there we'll have to make a series of spike jumps from here"</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"That isn't it though. We're criminals in the Federation, we won't be able to just watlz in there with all out weapons and shit. The Last Resort has to be on their records as well, and as soon as they see our transponder we'll be taken in. So we need to spoof our transponder signal. Does anyone know any smugglers?"</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">"Avry has given us an operating budget of 2000 credits for getting our legs underneath us on our first mission."</mark> 

Assuming John will say he does, they will find [[Scoots]]

You all walk to the less reputable of the two markets on [[Terminus]], located in one of the rings on the offshoot of the center. You walk by stalls of dubious looking food, marketplaces for electronics and weapons you can tell are probably 50% complete junk, and towards one of the hallways shooting out from the center of the ring. Down it, you find a little shop hidden away in a corner with a few markings on the front, written in incredibly poor handwriting "Welcome yes hello come see Scoots for ur shipping needs". When you walk in, Amos is unable to fit through the door as it is a tiny shop, but it is shallow enough he can bend down and see the entirety of the inside. There you see a strange blue creature, a blue tapered torso lacking many discernable features like a head or appendages, rolling back and forth on a curved chair like object. The creature greets you excitedly as you enter:

- "Yes yes come in I am of the pleased to have been meeting you you will be purchasing shipping correct I am Scoots."
- The transponder spoofer is 700 credits
- At some point: "Good good Scoots and you become friends you ship yourselves through Scoots now Scoots also lets you talk to Fyre Sindicate for good price I give you my data card." And he bumps his desk with his body and a business card falls off of it with his contact info.

After that they are good to go.

They have to make 2 successful piloting/navigation checks to get to [[Svallga]].
- The first is a DC 15, second is a DC 15. 
	- If they fail, they need to roll a 1d100 on the failed drift navigation table.
	- They will need to refuel on their second jump, costs 500 credits. 
- The time it takes to get to Svallga is 4 days per hex divided by 2, so 12 days. 

The ship shudders out of metadimensional space into the Thorhil sector. A large yellow class G star sits quietly in the middle of the system. Ahead, the second planet from the sun, and your destination, comes into view. Svallga is a temperate planet with two major landmasses separated by large oceans, and from your position you get a good look at the light emanating from multiple large cities dotted across the surface. As the Last Resort burns towards the planet, it doesn't take long though before something else catches your eye: several imposing shapes sitting in high orbit above Svallga. In a minute, you are staring at the largest military fleet in the known sector: the Einsatzflottille Primara. A swarm of corvettes, battleships, and smaller ships surround a colossus of engineering, a massive ship large enough to be a city, the capital ship Omnis Dattelin. In the next moment you are hailed by the Planet's control system:

- "Greetings transport uhhhhh "is this right? That's the name? Alright." Greetings transport callsign Unmistakable Stench of Failure, this is Svallgan flight control please lower your shields and shut off your thrusters to prepare for a routine scan. Do you copy?"
- "Alright Unmistakable Stench of Failure you are free to land."

As you fly down to the planet, your navigation system leads you to the daytime side, and you fly down over an ocean towards the coast of one of the continents. Pretty soon, you see the city come into view, sitting on an estuary next to the ocean: [[Svallga#Koblenz|Koblenz]]. A modestly large city, housing maybe a million inhabitants, it makes an unmistakable impression. Modern Federation style buildings and skyscrapers dominate a majority of the space, with their sleek glass and steel frames and clean angular faces. However, what draws your attention are the other type of structure nestled between the modern chic throughout the city: ancient buildings of intricate stonework and metal, they stick out strikingly in between the newer construction. Buildings built centuries ago by the Terran Mandate, all are much more ornately designed than the rest of the city. Two of these grab your attention more than others: a massive wall that surrounds a majority of the city, and a massive building sitting on top of a hill next to the shipyards. It has a central building with a tapered roof, with two towers jutting up higher than anything else in the city. It is obviously more ornate than even the other Mandate buildings, with a massive number of buttresses, statues, and other detailing covering its surface.

Right next to it is the shipyard, and the control tower comes on over the comms and directs you to an open spot. You land between two other ships and the engines shutter off. [[Boomerang]] speaks up: "Alright I think its time to go over our options. We need to find a way into the [[Svallga#Sanctum Bundesarchiv|Sanctum Bundesarchiv]] and have some sort of idea of how to manipulate the data in there to get rid of our criminal status. I have a basic layout of the archives, but something more detailed would probably be good. As I see it, our current objective is information gathering. Anyone got good ideas on where to start? Or just go somewhere in the city and start looking around for info?"

 - Have [[Amos]] make a perception check (DC: 12), and [[Jean-Pierre]] make recall knowledge checks (DC 15)
	 - If [[Amos]] succeeds: "Amos, you notice on the map of the city something you haven't seen in quite a while, the symbol of the [[Nchak Ascendancy]], the government of the Trox that you left. The embassy sits in the middle of the city, and is potentially the only connection you have on this planet."
	 - If [[Jean-Pierre]] succeeds: "You archeologist eye is caught by the Koblenz Historical Society, somewhere that potentially has good information on the older aspects of the city, including the Sanctum Bundesarchiv"

Wherever they go first, have them make a perception check DC 17. If they pass:
- You all notice as you travel the city that there are some of the people on the street that seem to be taking special interest in you. A glance here, someone following you there. You notice one man in a long coat and hat inconspicuously lift up his datapad a little as he sits on a bench and point it in your direction strangely. You can't tell how many of the people on the street are paying close attention to you, but its more than zero.

## Sanctum Bundesarchiv First visit no plan

No encounter difficulty. NPCs: Receptionist at the first desk, and official receptionist at the back desk for letting in people to the deeper archives. 2 guards there as well.

## Altenkirchen

You all head downtown to the Altenkirchen ward of the city, where there is mostly new construction and tall skyscrappers. As head further in, the sun begins to set and the city becomes awash in neon light and night life. You reach the densest part of downtown, and there are people everywhere milling about, going to bars and nightclubs, and generally seeming to have a good time. It seems a little seedy here, but everything that you can see at a glance looks completely above board. What are you all looking about for? Asking questions and things? Give me specifics for what type of information you are looking for, and then we'll roll a Culture check, for gathering information and I will tell you what each of you finds out.

- There is a prominent gang in Koblenz that has been rumored to be searching for a way into the old underground sectors of the city, the ones built by the terran mandate for some reason, and have butted heads with the local law enforcement over it a couple times. 

In Altenkirchen, have them make a perception check. DC 21. If they pass, they notice the three [[Eberswalde]] agents following them. There is another that has a sniper at the end of the road that they can't really see. 

### Koblenz Historical Society

You find it in the Steinweg section of the city, hear the western wall. This section seems more relaxed and residential than the rest of the city, however the buildings are still quite tall. The Society itself is located in one of the old Terran mandate structures, repurposed it seems to serve the Historical societies needs. Through the millennia old doors, which although look like stone from far away now you are up close seems to be made of some type of metal, you find a quiet space with virtually nobody around. There are some plaques and other displays, and in the center of the room appears to be a scaled down model of the city, only how it appeared in the past. Once you walk in, [[Friedrech Muller]] will greet you.

Make a perception check on the model of the city. DC 15.
