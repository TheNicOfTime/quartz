# Making their starship

Size options: Small or Medium

Tier 2: Build points: 75

They can build whatever ship they want with their build points. The drift engine is actually the Spike Drives, and goes up one level to 30xsize category.

# Describing [[Terminus]]

A huge space station that has several space ship docks, a casino, night club, apartments, restaurants, a refueling station, basic shipyard for repairs/upgrades, and two different marketplaces: a day market and a night market. 

Terminus serves both as the home base for [[Tiandi]], a mercenary group, and a minor trade hub for some planets. 

As you all increase the reputation of [[Tiandi]], [[Terminus]] will gain more traders and access to goods. Other benefits will become available as well. 

The plan is to integrate the Faction system from Stars Without Number and some of the Settlement building stuff for Terminus.

# Discussing contracts

Let them ask anything they want about the contracts and the world for the contracts. 

At some point they go to the mess hall and meet [[Skidds]] and his crew. Skidds will tell them about [[Boomerang]]'s three previous crews that all got killed in some fashion.

- "Well what do we have here? Boomerang's newest crew huh? Man I pity you poor fools, you must've fucked up pretty to end up with him."
- If pressed, he'll say: "Oh ho ho, you don't even know huh? About Boomerang's previous crews? He hasn't told you?"
- "What number is this now [[Groq]]? 4? He's had three crews previously. All of them have ended up meeting unfortunate ends. Boomerang's cursed. I'd get out while you still can."
