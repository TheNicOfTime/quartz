Alexander De Leon, current assassin for [[Eberswalde]] he is currently on mission to infiltrate the space station and eliminate (insert person of interest here), he is a android but with the Impersonation Matrix feature so he can look like a normal human if he wishes. He's an operative with the Ghost specialization so super stealthy and uses a sniper as his primary weapon. I'm basing him off Zevran Arainai from dragon age, sauv√© individual with a love for battle and love making.
