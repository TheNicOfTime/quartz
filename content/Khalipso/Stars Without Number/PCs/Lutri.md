# Background
Lutri is a famed lawyer renowned for his defense of Lemonade Sampson and largely for a quote in the case of the murder of the mermodels, the disgruntled human Ã—-husband allegedly left a flipper at the underwater home of his x-wife's new girlfriend (among many other details) but as part of his defense, Lutri made him try it on. When the flipper could not be made to fit Lutri fervently proclaimed "If the flipper doesn't fit, you must acquit". The jury in the case later went on to find Sampson innocent.
