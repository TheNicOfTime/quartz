# Written Backstory

“Nuros” was part of a merc company that received a job to pick up some civilians on some backwater hostile world. Upon meeting the client Grunt and his team realized they just played cowboy for a gang of slavers led by some suite breaking his own code. Thus he did what honor demanded and drove his shotgun into the lead slaver. A firefight ensued leading to the death of most of his squad and a good number of the civilians. Dying in combat would be far to an honorable death for him so rather the slavers off loaded him onto some backyard prison station.
