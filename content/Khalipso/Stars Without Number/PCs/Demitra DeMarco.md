She’s calm and collected in demeanor and an utter natural at diversion and subterfuge. In combat, Demitra’s strength lies in her willingness to adapt on the fly and be a useful distraction for her compatriots to succeed. Whenever she’s not out on a gig, she’s known for being glued to multiple screamsheets and datapads that relate to her parents’ death. Or, she can be found tinkering with her signature gulch gun and gadgets, prepping for her next foray in the Khalipso Sector.

**PERSONALITY**

_“Demitra DeMarco, pleasure to meet you… Let’s get to biz, yeah?”_

Demitra learned very quickly from her uncle to keep her motives and goals close to her chest. So, she tends to keep a very neutral position around people that’s not in her inner circle and tends to stay focused on the task at hand.

Those who get close to her, begin to see a woman who’s a living fountain of information. She’s seems to have a fun fact or anecdote on a myriad of topics, granted most have a tough time discerning if the stories she tells are true or grand fabrications. And she tends to always be looking forward to the next job.

**HISTORY**

Demitra is the daughter of two brilliant well-known engineers in the Federation named Lukas and Tessa DeMarco. Her childhood barely knew strife as her small family lived in a rich corner of the Khalipso Sector. However, her life would take a turn for the worse after discovering one day that her parents were brutally murdered by an unknown assailant.

Promptly adopted by her uncle, Viceroy Valentine, the duo quickly fled, fearing the possibility of either of them being potential targets for the killer. Once settled in the shadier parts of the Khalipso Sector, Viceroy polished off his old mercenary gear and got to work finding who killed Demitra’s parents. This left Demitra alone on many nights to grieve and come to terms with her parents passing.

After a few years of stubborn persistence from Demitra, Viceroy began to teach her how to operate as an “independent contractor” within the Khalipso Sector. When she came of age, Viceroy took her out on her first few gigs to truly test her mettle. And she rose to the occasion and excelled, using her charm and cool head to complete most of her gigs. The two then took to the Sector, taking on gigs to keep their cramped starship afloat and fund their investigation.

However, age eventually caught up with Viceroy and he decided to retire the mercenary work to Demitra while he continued the search for the killer via his remote channels and contacts. Meanwhile, Demitra decided to venture out in the Sector, taking riskier jobs to expand her fame and gain the attention of potential allies that could help.

Her most recent job involved her intermingling with a notorious crimelord named Xero. Xero’s son, Lobos, has recently been imprisoned after a job gone bad and needs Demitra’s services to protect him from harm. With help from Xero, a plan was set in motion to send Demitra to prison under false charges to keep Lobos alive. However, the processing stage of Demitra’s imprisonment took too long, and Lobos was already dead upon her arrival to the prison. With no gig and Xero going radio silent after the discovery of his son’s death, Demitra will be wallowing in prison until her false sentence is up.
