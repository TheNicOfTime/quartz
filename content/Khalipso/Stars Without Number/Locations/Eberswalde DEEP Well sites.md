# Eberswalde DEEP well site 4 (The Shard)

**Nickname: The Shard**

A prison that almost no-one comes out of once they arrive, including the guards. Only top level brass get to leave the station, which includes the warden, spacedock chief, chief of staff, and on-site 3-star general.

The Shard is an old installation, a space station that has been in orbit around a black hole for longer than the Federation has existed. It could be Mandate tech, however no one really knows. The station itself is a large spike with eight rectangular projections consisting of the prison cells jutting out perpendicular from the center of the spike. A ring surrounds and connects the ends of the cell blocks, and houses all of the guards and administration. The center spike has an upper section, which contains the shipyard where the incoming and outgoing prisoners come through, as well as an impound for the starships from the various prisoners. The very peak of this spike is the warden's office. The lower half of the spike is only reachable through a central elevator, and is the most well guarded part of the prison. You do not know what is down there, but you assume it is where the worst prisoners are kept. 

The bottom half of the spike contains the [[math drive]]. This is what explodes during the prison escape.
