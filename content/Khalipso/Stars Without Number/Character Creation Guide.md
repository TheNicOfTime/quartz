1. Step 1: choose a race. There are several races in the main book, and 4 alien archive expansion books, you can find those in the rules channel. This website has all the playable races: https://aonsrd.com/Races.aspx?ItemName=All

2. Pick a theme. Mostly for background for your character, at first level they give you a +1 to an ability score and specific knowledge. 
	1. Example: Priest. Gives +1 WIS and theme knowledge of a diety or philosophy. This reduces the DC of Culture and Mysticism checks to recall knowledge about religious traditions, religious symbols, and famous religious leaders by 5. Mysticism becomes a class skill.
3. Choose a class. On the character sheet, it is under the Features tab. All playable classes: https://www.starjammersrd.com/classes/

5. Apply your class
6. Hit points: At 1st level, you gain the number of Hit Points listed in your race entry + the number of Hit Points listed in your class’s description
7. Your Stamina Points are determined by your Constitution score and your class. At each level, you gain a number of Stamina Points equal to the SP value listed in your class description + your Constitution modifier
8. Resolve Points: You have a number of Resolve Points equal to half your character level (rounded down, but minimum 1) + the modifier of your key ability score
9. Assign skill ranks and choose feats
10. Alignment: You do not need to fill in alignment unless you want to, or you are playing a character with a specific requirement for alignment in their class (like a patron god or something).
11. Armor class: Energy Energy Armor Class (EAC) and Kinetic Armor Class (KAC) represent how difficult your character is to hit in combat. The values for EAC and KAC each begin at 10. Add your character’s Dexterity modifier to each value. Then add the EAC bonus and KAC bonus that her armor provides to the respective values. You’ll also want to note your character’s Armor Class against combat maneuvers, which is her KAC + 8.
12. You noted your character’s base attack bonus in Step 6, but you still need to calculate her total attack bonuses with melee, ranged, and thrown weapons. To do so, add her Strength modifier to her melee and thrown attacks, and add her Dexterity modifier to her other ranged attacks. Then add any miscellaneous modifiers from feats or class features to the appropriate attacks.
