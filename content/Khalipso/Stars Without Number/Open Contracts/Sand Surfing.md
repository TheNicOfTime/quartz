Description:

After seeing the bounties on the heads on Sotho and [[Zathir]], I decided to see if I could get in contact and work some angles. After some finagling, I got a tip on a job. The [[Alcippe resistance movement]], or ARM of Alcippe, is hiring mercenaries for a hush-hush assault on a holy site to the people of [[Alcippe]], to try and retake it from the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. This job doesn't pay extremely well up front, but looting of the well fortified site is being permitted as long as nothing of the holy site itself is taken. We have a contact on the ground in Alcippe, when you land and meet up with them they will give you more details.
