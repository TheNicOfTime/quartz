Title: Clear your names

Client: [[Avry Raeyen]]

Reward: 2000 credits

Requirements: Ship transport, 5-6 crew

Reputation: +10 [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]

Description:

So bounties have popped up on all of our heads. Everyone who was on the Shard are apparently now on the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] wanted board. This is a mission proposed by [[Avry Raeyen|the Boss]] to clear our names from the books to make it easier for us to take jobs from the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]], the largest single employer of [[Tiandi]]. While we remain wanted criminals, all jobs from the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] will carry an intermediary fee of 2000 credits. 

You all will be breaking into the central [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] records administration to mess with their records. This is located on Svallga, the capital planet of the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. I have to be honest, this isn't going to be easy and we don't really have a plan of attack. We'll be hoping for the best once we land on Svallga. I'll be working on trying to make in roads on this in the mean time.
