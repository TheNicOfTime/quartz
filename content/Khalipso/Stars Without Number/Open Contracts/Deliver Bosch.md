Reputation: +10 [[The Poleus Bloc]]

Description:

An opportunity to finish what we started. We need to deliver Bosch to the Bloc Government, and the dropoff point is a remote refueling station in the Maja system. This should be a simple meet and transfer, but knowing the luck wrapped up in this job something is bound to go wrong.
