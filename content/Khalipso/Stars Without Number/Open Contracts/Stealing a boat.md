Title: Stealing a boat

Client: [[Zaiba Corp]]

Reward: 1100 credits per crew member

Requirements: 2-4 crew

Reputation: +5 [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]

Description:

A huge megacorp based in the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]], Zaiba Corp, that makes a good chunk of the starships in the sector also deals in high-end luxury speed yachts, you read that right *yachts*, and apparently their most recent experimental boat was stolen. The boat is apparently being used in an illegal boat race, and they are hiring a crew to get it back. Unfortunately they have no leads on who might have stolen the boat, or how to even go about finding it. All they know is the boat has been entered by an anonymous group in the race. Zaiba is hiring mercenaries to enter the race, make sure the prototype boat isn't scrapped during the race, and steal it back at the end.

Summary:

Zaiba Corp is offering 1100 credits per member of a 2-4 person crew to regain ownership of our intellectual property. A yacht has been stolen from our compound and has been entered in an illegal race on [[Principality of Santell]]. As our security forces are all proud citizens of the Federation, our influence on a backwater planet such as Santell is limited. Payment will be given upon successful delivery of the yacht, intact, back to Svallga.
