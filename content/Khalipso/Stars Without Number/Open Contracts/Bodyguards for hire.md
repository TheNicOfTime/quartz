Boomerang's Introduction:

The Thucalan Royal Family is hiring a cadre of bodyguards to supplement the royal guard during a diplomatic mission to meet the [[The Poleus Bloc]]. You will be guarding a diplomat from Thucala in coordination with the royal guard as you escort him to Poleus, to his meeting with the Bloc diplomats, and back to [[Thucala]]. 

[[Thucala]] just went through a transfer of power between the previous royal family which leaned more towards the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] and the new one which seems to want to cozy up to the Bloc much more. This diplomatic mission is the first step with that, but the election that the new royal family just won is being called into question by a large part of the [[Thucala]] populace and some protests have turned violent, so I would imagine something could occur during this mission. 

Full job posting:

The Thucalan Royal Guard is recruiting mercenaries for brief 1-week contract for the honor of accompanying the Thucalan Royal Family on their diplomatic mission to the Poleus Bloc. You will be in charge of security for our newly appointed ambassador to [[The Poleus Bloc|Poleus]] on a momentous occasion as they meet with the Bloc diplomat for the first time. Applicants must come to [[Thucala]], where you will board the ambassador's ship and begin your assignment. Payment will be provided after successful return of the ambassador to [[Thucala]].
