Description:

A rich archaeologist from [[Alcippe]] is looking for adventurers to accompany her to explore a planet through a recently charted metaspace lane. Her job offer goes on and on frankly like a crazy person, however she pays handsomely and who doesn't like a little adventuring glory of discovering a new world? From what I can tell, she commissioned the rutter to this system and is currently the only person in possession of the charts. So, you should be the first contact with whatever awaits you on the planet. 

Full job posting:

Hello adventurers! I am looking for a couple rough-and-ready nere-do-wells to accompany me on the opportunity of a lifetime! A culmination of years of work, I have recently come into possession of a stellar rutter to the as of yet unexplored Maja system. Well, not totally unexplored as I have been visiting the planet in this system for a long time in my dreams. Something on the planet calls to me, something glorious and grand, and I must seek it out! Not only will we be exploring a new system, we will be  restoring the glory of the Terran Mandate! Unfortunately my peers are skeptical and unintelligent swine, so I have been forced to resort to hiring help on this journey. I will pay you all as soon as we arrive safely back on Alcippe.
