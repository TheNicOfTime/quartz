# Setting
The campaign takes place in Kalipso sector, a large sector of interconnected space embroiled in a 60-year long cold-war between two superpowers, the [[The Federation of United Planets]] and the [[The Poleus Bloc]]. 65 years ago a team of brilliant scientists unlocked the potential of ancient artifacts found in the sector called Math Drives, ancient pieces of tech that are still not fully understood that can produce potentially infinite amounts of energy. The sector quickly became dependent on these drives for energy, before it was discovered that these drives work in tandem across any amount of space, and deactivating one deactivates them all. This established a method of mutual destruction that prevented the Federation and the Bloc from waging all out war on each other.

Since the start of the conflict, a majority of planets/systems in the sector have become “officially” part of the FUP or Bloc, but most planets retain their autonomy and the superpowers’ governmental presence on these planets is minimal. 

The Federation and the Bloc constantly vie for superiority using espionage, proxy wars, and accumulation of pre-scream artifacts and technology. Many of these jobs have been contracted out to adventurers, pirates, and other individuals who have no particular alliance but will work for anyone's money. 

This delicate balance has just been upset by an incursion of cosmic horror from a corner of the sector always considered wild space and impossible to traverse.

# Messages 

Messages in the Khalipso sector travel in four methods:

- Light-speed signals sent across the sector, traveling at a period of 1 week/hex. This can only occur if there is a receiver at the end. Generally considered unsecure, but easier to accomplish
- General message transport: Messages are sent to a relay that then send them to traveling ships to the desired sector. When arriving at the new sector, messages are automatically sent to the relay in the hex. Much quicker than light speed, and generally more secure as the messages are encrypted. Travels at 1 hex/day. However, ships are not screened. A more secure version uses only registered messenger ships that travels slower at 2 days/hex. 
- Quantum-entangled comm units: Extremely expensive gear that allow instantaneous completely secure messaging between two quantum entangles comm units. Only the Terran Mandate was able to make these, so they are very hard to find.
- Magical means.
