The [[Nchak Ascendancy]] ambassador to the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]], a very high up position in the government. A very straight-laced Trox, unlike [[Amos]], who always does things by the book and non-violently. Has butted heads with [[Amos]] multiple times in the past over the inaction of the [[Nchak Ascendancy]] during times [[Amos]] thinks they should have intervened. Also talks with an Australian accent like all Trox in this universe. 

# Session 4

On [[Svallga]], he has diplomatic passes that allow limited access to the [[Svallga#Sanctum Bundesarchiv]]. He is very unwilling to give these up willingly to them because he doesn't trust [[Amos]] to do things nonviolently, and he also knows they are likely criminals and may get the Embassy in trouble, which would be bad as the Ascendancy worked very hard to grab even this much attention from the Federation. 

He will let them know he has these passes in his desk, which has a computer lock on it with a trap.
