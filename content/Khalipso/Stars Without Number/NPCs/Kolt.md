# Description

An average height human woman with shoulder length purple hair and a red scarf draped over her white prison jumpsuit. Is pretty jovial usually but can get pretty intense when she feels slighted. A little bit of a hothead, but keeps the people under her happy.

# Why she is in Prison

Was previously the head of a large drug cartel on [[Oregota]], who got caught up in a bust by the Federation. 

# What she wants

[[Kolt]] wants to actually take over the station completely and set up a new drug smuggling business out of [[Eberswalde DEEP Well sites#Eberswalde DEEP well site 4]] aka the Shard. She has been biding her time, trying to amass enough prisoners in her gang to start a prison riot to take over the prison. The prison has a spike drive she can use to move it. 

She had worked hard to be on good terms with the guards of the Shard.

A human outlaw level 4.
