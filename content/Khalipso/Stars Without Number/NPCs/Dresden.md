A dark skinned man with a shaven head and tattoos on his left arm depicting a serpent creature from his homeworld. 

A human operative on the Shard who knows [[Boomerang]] from back when they were on a smuggling ship together as crew. He is now part of [[Kolt]]'s gang which happened after [[Boomerang]] and him left their smuggling ship and he joined her drug smuggling operation. He is fairly loyal to [[Kolt]], but is willing to help get the supplies for the crew for a price.

He can give them access to 1000 UPBs(Universal Polymer Base) and a small workshop in a cell to craft anything they want. They will have 4 hours, just enough for one person to craft one thing.
