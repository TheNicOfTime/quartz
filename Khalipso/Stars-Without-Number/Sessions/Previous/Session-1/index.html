We are playing in the Stars without number universe mostly, so I&rsquo;ll give a brief introduction and backstory. Hundreds of years ago, most of the galaxy was connected through metadimensional travel, either through the use of science like spike drives and Jump Gates, or through magical means that are too numerous to count but usually much more volatile. One day, a massive wave of metadimensional energy ripped through the entirety of the galaxy, completely destroying spike drives, jump gates, and any psychics currently connected to the warp. This event, later called &ldquo;the Scream&rdquo;, was followed by a period of disconnection, scientific atrophy, and loss of communication as the Warp and all other dimensions became inaccessible for close to 600 years. Gradually, all these disconnected planets have begun taking to the stars again in the hopes of regaining the glory of the pre-scream stellar empires.</p><p>You all are in the the Kalipso sector! A large chunk of connected space still expanding, connecting, and exploring all of the worlds within its reach. It is currently embroiled in a decades long power struggle between two interstellar superpowers, the Federation of United Planets and the Poleus Bloc. For 60 years, these two superpowers have been been vying for galactic supremacy through espionage, research, and proxy wars.</p><p>However, none of you probably care much about all of that right now. You all are currently on a prison transport craft, being shuttled from whatever local jailhouse on whatever local planet to you were previously on after being picked up one by one as the ship makes its circuitous journey. One of the guards traveling with you on this journey has informed you that you (5/6) are lucky enough to be guests at the Shard, something most of you probably haven&rsquo;t heard of before. You all, however, are just overflow from around the Federation, and the Shard apparently has plenty of extra room.</p><p>You (5/6) are seated across from each other in the back of the shuttle. Hands cuffed in front of you, feet bound in shackles, and those with magical powers have collars around your necks that are dampening your powers. There is one other prisoner in here with you all, a scrawny looking Vesk (<a class="internal-link broken">Julius</a>) sitting next you <a class="internal-link broken">Amos</a>. The back of the shuttle is an airlock, towards the from is a locked door that presumably leads to the rest of the ship and the cockpit. There was another prisoner, a small green and red hobgoblin that was the last stop the shuttle did before making towards your new home, but the guards took him deeper into the ship leaving you inmates here by yourselves.</p><p>So, let&rsquo;s go around and introduce the characters, what they look like and what kinda vibes you putting out there.</p><a href=#play-part-1><h1 id=play-part-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Play part 1</h1></a><p>The journey is going to take about ~1 hour, they have an hour to do stuff on the ship before they arrive at the Shard. (This will be about an hour of real time as well as in-game time.) With the cuffs on, you have the Entangled condition (You move at half speed, you cannot run or charge, and you take a â€“2 penalty to your AC, attack rolls, Reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks.)</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Julius</a> in a wiry snivvly accent: &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be here, I didn&rsquo;t do anything! I shouldn&rsquo;t be locked up with these CRIMINALS! I&rsquo;m just a data analyst!&rdquo; and is generally freaking out. At some point he asks why they are all here.</p><p><strong>5 or 4 CR (XP budget of 1,600 or 1,200)</strong></p><p>Want to make it possible but extremely unlikely that they could break out completely right here, but likely enough that they will get out of the holding cell to overhear a conversation that will be useful in breaking out of the prison later.</p><p>[[Boomerang]] is on this ship with them, being held in another area because he is considered higher risk due to being from the <a class="internal-link broken">Terminus</a> gang. If they encounter him here he will tell them he knows someone on the inside who can get them an emp grenade to help break out if they help him out.</p><a href=#encounters><h2 id=encounters><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Encounters</h2></a><a href=#in-the-ship><h3 id=in-the-ship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>In the ship</h3></a><a href=#3-guards-cr-2-1800><h4 id=3-guards-cr-2-1800><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3 guards (CR 2, 1,800)</h4></a><p>XP 600

It could be Mandate tech, however no one really knows. The station itself is a large spike with eight rectangular projections consisting of the prison cells jutting out perpendicular from the center of the spike. A ring surrounds and connects the ends of the cell blocks, and houses all of the guards and administration. The center spike has an upper section, which contains the shipyard where the incoming and outgoing prisoners come through, as well as an impound for the starships from the various prisoners. The very peak of this spike is the warden&rsquo;s office. The lower half of the spike is only reachable through a central elevator, and is the most well guarded part of the prison. You do not know what is down there, but you assume it is where the worst prisoners are kept.</p><a href=#intro-for-the-breakout><h3 id=intro-for-the-breakout><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Intro for the breakout:</strong></h3></a><p>For the past few weeks, you all have banded together to plan a prison break.
