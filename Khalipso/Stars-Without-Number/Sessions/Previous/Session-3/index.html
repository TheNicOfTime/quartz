The first group are those who are associated with the Poleus Bloc, generally political prisoners or people who hail from Bloc planets. The other factions consists of most everyone else, terrorists, prisoners, gang members, and anyone imprisoned with no connection to the Bloc.</p><a href=#the-six-runes><h3 id=the-six-runes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Six Runes</h3></a><p>This gang is headed by a mystic priest named <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a>, an enigmatic priest who is here to find <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>. When they go to see Sven, if they go from <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a> to try to get him to not interfere he will ask if they know what she is planning. It will be hard to convince him to not interfere, because he fears for <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>&rsquo;s life if she gains control. if they do convince him, he will ask them to retrieve data from the storage room on all of the prisoners in the prison from the storage room. If they bring it back to him, or if they break the encryption on it themselves, they will find that there are several prisoners that have been assigned to the maintenance room in the middle of the station, including <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>.</p><p>This gang is headed by a mystic priest named <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a>, an enigmatic priest who is basically at war with the guards of the prison, trying to break out and take over the prison. Working with them Sven will send them to the storage wing to sneak in and get a crate for them. Doing so will allow The Six Runes to attempt a riot, and distract the guards for the escape plan. They also know that several Poleus Bloc political prisoners, specifically scientists, have mysteriously disappeared from the prison and they would appreciate any info the players find on them.</p><a href=#the-other-gang><h3 id=the-other-gang><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The other gang</h3></a><p>Doesn&rsquo;t have a name, has a working relationship with the guards to try to prevent the escape of the Six Runes in exchange for entertainment (The Fight pit), drugs, food, and other things. When they go to try to get help from this gang, they will have to prove their worth by fighting in the fight pit. Headed by a human outlaw named <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>. Getting in good with them they will lure the guards out to the fight pit where they will let you and might help you get keycard access to the Shard in the center of the prison.</p><a href=#preparing-for-the-riot><h2 id=preparing-for-the-riot><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Preparing for the riot</h2></a><a href=#starting-the-session><h2 id=starting-the-session><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Starting the Session</h2></a><p><a class="internal-link broken">Nuros</a> will wander off at the beginning of the session as they are walking over to <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a>&rsquo;s informant mumbling something under his breath about preparing for the sanctity of battle.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Jean-Pierre</a> will be at the discussion with Boomerang&rsquo;s informant, but <a class="internal-link broken">Jean-Pierre</a> will decide to stay with <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> to work on some gadgets for the riot.</p><a href=#talking-to-boomerangs-informant><h3 id=talking-to-boomerangs-informant><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Talking to <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a>&rsquo;s informant</h3></a><p>You approach a table with a man sitting by himself tinkering with some electronic device. He has dark skin, a shaved head, and very obvious tattoo of a serpent creature spanning the length of his left arm. He looks up as he notices you all approach and you see a severe and handsome face glance at each one of you before settling on <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a>. He nods and opens with &ldquo;So Boomerang, this is who you are rolling with now? I heard this whole group got in trouble with <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>. Not people I&rsquo;d be associating with if I were you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Now now <a class="internal-link broken">Dresden</a> give &rsquo;em a chance. We&rsquo;ve actually come to ask for some help.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh yeah? And what could I do for you.&rdquo;</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a>&rsquo;s informant is a member of <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s gang. His name is <a class="internal-link broken">Dresden</a>. If they convince him to help him out, he can give them access to 1000 UPBs(Universal Polymer Base) and a small workshop in a cell to craft anything they want. They will have 4 hours, just enough for one person to craft one thing. <a class="internal-link broken">Dresden</a> will also offer to introduce them to a brand new prisoner (<a class="internal-link broken">Alexander De Leon</a>) who arrived shortly after and may be willing to help them. <a class="internal-link broken">Alexander De Leon</a> will be in a cell in Cell Block A.</p><p>At some point <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> will suggest looking over the data they got from the computer in more detail. Can use a Perception or Profession check if the profession has to do with searching through data. He will also ask about the prison guards if they haven&rsquo;t thought of them already. If they search they can find the guards naked in the showers, the other guard is still under the bunk in the other room.</p><p>DC 17, can probably take 20 to search through. Bring this up.</p><ul><li>On a success: Each prisoner entry has a brief description of the prisoner. You notice a pattern to the prisoners assigned to cell block E. A majority of them are scientists from the Poleus Bloc with an emphasis on physics and energy production, but there are a few others that are not. These prisoners appear to all be Solarians, something that is exceedingly rare in this sector. These are marked as &ldquo;assigned to containment duty&rdquo;.</li><li>They can also find files on each of the PCs, which describes the crimes they committed.</li></ul><p>They can find the two guards they killed in the showers, but they will be stripped and picked clean. The third guard they can find the body of in the cell still and steal their outfit still.</p><p>When they talk to <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a> she will be in the fight pit discussing with some of her underlings what the plan is. She will ask for proof that <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a> will not interfere in the riot.</p><a href=#prison-riot><h2 id=prison-riot><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Prison riot</h2></a><p>The guards will come out and make a perimeter to the central room.</p><a href=#kolts-plan><h3 id=kolts-plan><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s plan:</h3></a><p>Once they are there, <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s gang will ambush them. Two of <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s men will have taken the outfits from the two guards near the storage room and will have integrated with the guards as they come out and will initiate the ambush. If Kolt is able to get the spike drive to go off, the station will travel to a place with multiple starships surrounding it that are loyal to Kolt.</p><p>After a minute, <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a>&rsquo;s gang will rush in as well. They will need to pacify the one guard with the keycard access to get the door to open. They will have to fight one of the guards and one of <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s men at first.</p><p><a href=/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/Sessions/Previous/Prison-Riot-combat-encounter rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/Sessions/Previous/Prison-Riot-combat-encounter>Prison Riot combat encounter</a></p><p>Once they pass through the door into the room, they will feel something similar to what they felt went they passed out and were shunted into the Shard beforehand, except this time it also happens to their physical bodies. <code>As you step through the doorway into darkness you feel a psychic pull similar to what you felt when the whole station passed out. Once again you feel your mind slip towards the center of the station, only this time your physical body follows. You feel and see the swirling green energy you saw before, but much more intensly this time as it seems to slither through every wrinkle of your brain. You awaken moments later lying on the ground in a room much bigger than you expected to be in.</code> They pass out and wake up in the Shard room, which has a small almost pocket dimension around it that allows the room to be bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.</p><p>They can see the Shard up close. <code>A swirling mass of black that seems to suck in all light from the surroundings while simultaneously appearing shiny like obsidian, you can't quite look at it directly. Whenever you do, you seem to avert your gaze without meaning to.</code></p><p>There are a couple of Poleus Bloc scientists in here researching the Shard against their will, as the Bloc has the formost scientists on math drive tech. One of them is <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>. They are all wearing special goggles to protect against the math drive.</p><ul><li>Wisdom saving through to see more of it (DC 15)<ul><li>Pass: You are able to concentrate on the obelisk and notice the swirling is actually in the form of numbers and mathematical formulas shifting and solving themselves over and over again across the surface of the rock.</li><li>Fail: take 1d4 psychic damage and you are dazzled as long as you are in the presence of this rock. as you feel&mldr;. something invade your mind.</li></ul></li><li><em>Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Physical Science):</em><ul><li>DC: 21</li><li>If they pass: This is a humungous math drive, larger than any you have heard about before, and there aren&rsquo;t many in the known galaxy. These drives are the central pieces in the ongoing sector wide cold war, and the Federation appears to have one substantially bigger than the Bloc by the looks of it. The control panel near by also appears to be esoteric tech, not made by the Federation, and seems to be regulating the absolutely massive power this shard must be putting out. If Demitra passes: she specifically recognizes some of the gear/machinery in the room, it vaguely resembles machines she remembers seeing in her parents workshop when she was small.</li></ul></li></ul><p>If they touch the math drive, they will feel like their whole body is buzzing with static, as if every part of them had fallen asleep. Although it feels just like unordered static, you could swear the static is screaming at you with an anger you can&rsquo;t fully understand. If they touch it they will need to make a DC 17 Will Save or go on the Wisdom Poison track (Freq: 1/day).</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a> will exclaim &ldquo;What is going on? Who are all of you?&rdquo; He will notice <a class="internal-link broken">Qusari</a> and exclaim, his eyes widening &ldquo;You are a Solarian? This explains it, you threw off the balance with your presence we need to account for you or we will lose control&mldr;&rdquo; and trails off murmuring to himself. He will also recognize <a class="internal-link broken">Demitra DeMarco</a> if she gets up close to him, as he knew her parents. She can make a straight up Int check (DC 18) to see if she remembers him. If she passes, she recognizes his mustache from when she was very young, her parents had invited him over for dinner and to discuss science things with him one night. He will tell her that he worked with them on engineering new output devices for math drives before he was run out of the Federation and took refuge in the Poleus Bloc. Brilliant minds both of them he will say.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a> will immediately go for <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>. <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a> will go for the control panel to hack in and force the station to make a spike jump to a random location. They will both try and stop each other.</p><p><a href="/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/Sessions/Previous/Prison-Riot-combat-encounter#Prison block E encounter" rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/Sessions/Previous/Prison-Riot-combat-encounter>Shard fight</a></p><p>When they set off the EMP, they feel a very strange compression as the room compacts and the semi-stable pocket dimension collapses. They need to make a DC 15 constitution save or take 1d6 Bludgeoning (Kinetic) damage. The station goes pitch black for a second. When the emergency lights come on, they can see that the Obelisk is swirling much faster now and a faint red glow is starting to come off of it, and it is getting more intense every moment. When they leave Cell Block E, they will notice everyone who was outside is passed out. They can probably make their way freely to</p><p>You all run down the hallway with carnage everywhere, bodies and blood splattering the whole hallway. As you run down, make a perception check.</p><ul><li><strong>Perception check: DC: 15</strong><ul><li>Pass: Somehow, maybe because you are all rattled or because of all of the carnage around you, you didn&rsquo;t notice a lone guard still standing until you are basically right on top of him. He is walking casually towards where you came from, but as you take a look you notice where their face should be instead you see the same swirling blackness and numbers from the math drive. The next second they walk past you, and if you turn around they are gone.</li></ul></li></ul><p>At the end of the hallway, the illusion being cast by a couple of <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s men has dissipated, however this doesn&rsquo;t matter as you see the guards outside the prison block passed out as well, and the cell block remains open.</p><p>After that battle they run to the dock and <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> directs him to an impounded ship. We will make the ship in the next session, for now just ask them what they want the concept of the ship to be and the general look. They fly out of the station and punch the spike drive. <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> has a secret coordinates to a beacon that allows travel directly to the Saritri Pala system. As they fly away, they see a couple other starcraft taking off (or landing if Kolt got the spike drive to go) from the station. After a while, you look back and see the red glow from the Shard becomes blinding for a moment before spikes jut out at every angle from it, piercing the station in dozens of locations and rending metal apart, before the Shard blinks out of existence leaving a broken ring of a space station behind.</p><p>If they are in Kolt&rsquo;s desired outcome: They need to make an evade check DC 14 or take 5d8 damage from a twin laser before getting away.</p><p>Once they jump, they jump to Saritri Pala system, and make their way in system to <a class="internal-link broken">Terminus</a>. As they fly there and through the spike jump they have a bit of time to decompress after the escape, allow them to do what they want. Once they exit metaspace, they have an hour or so flight to <a class="internal-link broken">Terminus</a>. As they fly they see: <code>Your recently stolen ship rounds the edge of the yellow star as you fly towards the beacon Boomerang has provided. Anyone on the bridge can see a large green gas giant come into view, with swirling clouds of various shades making up its vibrant surface. A little while later, you see the space station emiting the beacon you have been following: A humungous multi-part installation with several docking ports and bright neon lights blasting the name of the station into the void: Terminus. Your new home. Boomerang directs you to a particular dock, and after discussing with the landing crew for a minute you are allowed to enter. Boomerang them quickly ushers you through a part of the station that appears to be a casino for the ultra rich, and you all stick out like a sore thumb. After pushing you along into a back room, you are finally parked in front of a set of opulent doors that Boomerang dissapears into for a minute. Shortly after, he sticks his head back in and gestures for you all to come in.</code></p><p><code>When you enter you see a light skinned woman in a white tuxedo and a red bowtie with her legs up on a carved wooden table with holoprojectors showing video of what appears to be the entire station. She has dark black hair that has been shaved on one side where a cybernetic implant is obviously seen. She takes her legs down when you walk in and stands up.</code></p><p>&ldquo;So, these are the fine gentlemen and ladies that saved one of my favorite handlers from a Federation maximum security prison.
