Then she will burst out in anger at them and tell them they have fucked up.</p><ul><li><p>That guard was placed there as a show of goodwill and good behavior. We don&rsquo;t fuck with them, they won&rsquo;t fuck with us. This accord has been maintained and developed over a very long time, and you all think you can just arrive and the same day kill three guards and this not be a problem for me or for you? You are goddamn idiots and have almost ruined everything I have been working towards for the past year. Fortunately for you, there is still a chance to save this. You will be doing everything I say from here on out, and maybe I will be lenient on you.</p></li><li><p>If not, I know you all have seen the entertainment value. At the very least, we can offer you up as recommence and entertainment for the guards.</p></li><li><p>What I need you to do is convince those wackos in the East wing to stay out of our way today.

They will lead them directly to the cell <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a> is in, who they will find praying over a human witchwarper. A large Vesk will stop them before the door. The human will walk out, and Sven will come out and sit down in front of them on the floor and cross his insect legs.</p><p>This gang is headed by a mystic priest named <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a>, an enigmatic priest who is here to find <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>. When they go to see Sven, if they go from <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a> to try to get him to not interfere he will ask if they know what she is planning. It will be hard to convince him to not interfere, because he fears for <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>&rsquo;s life if she gains control. if they do convince him, he will ask them to retrieve data from the storage room on all of the prisoners in the prison from the storage room. If they bring it back to him, or if they break the encryption on it themselves, they will find that there are several prisoners that have been assigned to the maintenance room in the middle of the station, including <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>.</p><a href=#description-of-the-prison><h3 id=description-of-the-prison><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Description of the prison</strong></h3></a><p>The Shard is an old installation, a space station that has been in orbit around a black hole for longer than the Federation has existed. The station itself consists of a humungous black obelisk, seemingly made out of a shard of rock rather than metal. Eight rectangular spokes jut out near the center of the obelisk, forming part of a more conventional space station structure ringing the center. A ring surrounds and connects the ends of the cell blocks, and you see the dock you are coming in to land on as you approach.</p><ul><li><em>Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Culture or Physical Science):</em><ul><li>DC: 18</li><li>If they fail: they only know it looks like it isn&rsquo;t being used for its initial purpose and is very old. Maybe Mandate tech? The central shard of the station looks like it is carved from a black glassy rock, not metal or any traditional space building materials.</li><li>If they pass: This is older than the first new space faring civilization known in the Kalipso sector, but doesn&rsquo;t look like Mandate tech. It looks foreign, made by no civilization you are aware of. The black rock seems to shift constantly as if it were a liquid while retaining its shape, it looks like nothing you have ever seen before and gives off an ominous vibe.</li></ul></li></ul><p>When they arrive, <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> tells them to meet him in the mess hall as soon as they can. He gives them the EMP and tells them about the gangs. He also mentions that his previous crew were planning to break someone out of here, someone with the codename &ldquo;<a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>&rdquo;.</p><a href=#the-gangs-of-the-shard><h2 id=the-gangs-of-the-shard><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Gangs of the Shard</h2></a><p>There are two major factions of prisoners inside the Shard. The first group are those who are associated with the Poleus Bloc, generally political prisoners or people who hail from Bloc planets. The other factions consists of most everyone else, terrorists, prisoners, gang members, and anyone imprisoned with no connection to the Bloc.</p><a href=#the-six-runes-1><h3 id=the-six-runes-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Six Runes</h3></a><p>This gang is headed by a mystic priest named <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a>, an enigmatic priest who is basically at war with the guards of the prison, trying to break out and take over the prison. Working with them Sven will send them to the storage wing to sneak in and get a crate for them. Doing so will allow The Six Runes to attempt a riot, and distract the guards for the escape plan. They also know that several Poleus Bloc political prisoners, specifically scientists, have mysteriously disappeared from the prison and they would appreciate any info the players find on them.</p><a href=#the-other-gang><h3 id=the-other-gang><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The other gang</h3></a><p>Doesn&rsquo;t have a name, has a working relationship with the guards to try to prevent the escape of the Six Runes in exchange for entertainment (The Fight pit), drugs, food, and other things. When they go to try to get help from this gang, they will have to prove their worth by fighting in the fight pit. Headed by a human outlaw named <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>. Getting in good with them they will lure the guards out to the fight pit where they will let you and might help you get keycard access to the Shard in the center of the prison.</p><a href=#the-fight-pit-cr-5-xp-1600><h2 id=the-fight-pit-cr-5-xp-1600><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The fight pit (CR 5, XP 1,600)</h2></a><p>Flayer leech (CR 4 XP 1,200) and 2 Diathas (CR 1 XP 400)</p><p>At some point <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> will join to help them.</p><a href=#the-storage-wing><h2 id=the-storage-wing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Storage wing</h2></a><p>A dilapidated wing of the prison that looks like it was never set up for an actual purpose, it is very dark and obviously not well maintained in here. There are a bunch of old storage containers, mechanical parts, and broken down electrical equipment, the only thing that seems operational is a monitor in the middle of the room that casts a faint green light on the opposing wall. The monitor sits right in front of an old emergency airlock.</p><p>There is a trap once they enter the storage wing: CR 1 XP 400 (Laser blast trap, if they trip the sensors near the front of the room a laser turret will pop down and shoot them)
<img src="/Pasted image 20220402181010.png" title="/Pasted image 20220402181010.png"></p><p>Once they deal with the trap they find an old room filled with a bunch of useless electronics and long-term storage. The only useful thing is and old computer. There is also a disused emergency airlock in here.</p><p>The one operating computer to hack is DC 21. There is a firewall for prisoner information that is DC 23. If they fail once, they will hear a whirring as a giant magnet in the computer starts spinning and three Ferrofluid Ooze&rsquo;s will start to wake up. A warning pops up that repeated unauthorized access attempts will result in depressurization of the cabin. They will have to fail 4 times in a row for that to happen. They will get one more chance before the ooze&rsquo;s start moving towards them. The oozes don&rsquo;t particularly care about them, but they want to eat and destroy the computer. They will fight back though.</p><a href=#the-math-drive><h1 id=the-math-drive><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The math drive</h1></a><p>If they bring <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a> back the data, he will make a deal to get into the central room so he can help get <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a> out. He will offer to take them with him when he escapes (He is lying, he will cast the spell Plane Shift to get him and <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a> of station) He will allow <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a> to make a move during the guard switch out, but will attack at some point with you to get into the room. You need to go tell <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a> that <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a> won&rsquo;t bother her for her to start her riot though.</p><a href=#prison-riot><h2 id=prison-riot><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Prison riot</h2></a><p>If the talk to <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> first, he will express that he wants to get <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a> out with them, rather than will <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a> and that he doesn&rsquo;t trust the priest.</p><p>The guards will come out and make a perimeter to the central room. Once they are there, <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s gang will ambush them. After a minute, <a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a>&rsquo;s gang will rush in as well. They will need to pacify the one guard with the keycard access to get the door to open. They will have to fight one of the guards and one of <a class="internal-link broken">Kolt</a>&rsquo;s men at first.</p><p>Once they make it into the room, they can see the Shard up close. A swirling mass of black that seems to suck in all light from the surroundings while simultaneously appearing shiny like obsidian, you can&rsquo;t quite look at it directly. Whenever you do, your seem to avert your gaze without meaning to.</p><p>There are a couple of Poleus Bloc scientists in here researching the Shard against their will, as the Bloc has the formost scientists on math drive tech. One of them is <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>. They are all wearing special goggles to protect against the math drive.</p><ul><li>Wisdom saving through to see more of it (DC 15)<ul><li>Pass: You are able to concentrate on the obelisk and notice the swirling is actually in the form of numbers and mathematical formulas shifting and solving themselves over and over again across the surface of the rock.</li><li>Fail: take 1d4 psychic damage and you are dazzled as long as you are in the presence of this rock. as you feel&mldr;. something invade your mind.</li></ul></li><li><em>Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Physical Science):</em><ul><li>DC: 21</li><li>If they pass: This is a humungous math drive, larger than any you have heard about before, and there aren&rsquo;t many in the known galaxy. These drives are the central pieces in the ongoing sector wide cold war, and the Federation appears to have one substantially bigger than the Bloc by the looks of it. The control panel near by also appears to be esoteric tech, not made by the Federation, and seems to be regulating the absolutely massive power this shard must be putting out.</li></ul></li></ul><p>If they touch the math drive, they will feel like their whole body is buzzing with static, as if every part of them had fallen asleep. Although it feels just like unordered static, you could swear the static is screaming at you with an anger you can&rsquo;t fully understand.</p><p><a class="internal-link broken">Sven Tavzitro</a> will immediately go for <a class="internal-link broken">Bosch</a>.</p><p>When they set off the EMP, the station goes pitch black for a second and they can hear the battle start between the Six Symbols and the Guards. When the emergency lights come on, they can see that the Obelisk is swirling much faster now and a faint red glow is starting to come off of it, and it is getting more intense every moment. When they run down the hallway to the space dock, a guard they won&rsquo;t notice will pass them.</p><ul><li><strong>Perception check: DC: 15</strong><ul><li>Pass: they notice the guard, but where their face should be you see the same swirling blackness and numbers from the math drive. The next second they are gone.</li></ul></li></ul><p>They run into the guards at the end of the hallway if they have enough health, with some other prisoners to help (and <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a>). After that battle they run to the dock and <a class="internal-link broken">Boomerang</a> directs him to his impounded ship. We will make the ship in the next session. They fly out of the station and punch the spike drive. As they fly away, they see a couple other starcraft taking off from the station as the red glow from the Shard becomes blinding for a moment before spikes jut out at every angle from it, piercing the station in dozens of locations and rending metal apart, before the Shard blinks out of existence leaving a broken ring of a space station behind.</p><a href=#making-their-starship><h1 id=making-their-starship><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Making their starship</h1></a><p>We will build it later, just ask them what they want it to look like for now.
