For the most part, Starfinder will be the dominant game we will be using. Starfinder is based off of Pathfinder, and is somewhat similar in mechanics to DnD. However, we will be disregarding most of the lore from Starfinder and using Stars Without Number for the world and lore. This might be a little wonky, so if there is specific lore that you read in Starfinder that you think would be important to your character let me know and we can probably work it into the setting.</p><p>Some notes about the rules from the games below. Starfinder is a particularly dense book to get through, so I will try to highlight the things I think you should at least look at. I will do my best to guide you through the rules in the first sessions, but there are a <em>lot</em> of actions you can take as a PC that you might want to keep in mind since it is not feasible for me to remind you of all of them. HOWEVER I like having players just try to play a character as naturally as they like without worrying beforehand what specific actions the rules dictate you can take, so if you feel like you can be pretty inventive with your actions and don&rsquo;t just need a list of actions you can take, feel free to be more freeform with it and as we go we can map your actions onto specific rules/actions from the book. Starfinder seems to be pretty good at providing rules for doing most anything you can think of, so if you say you want to do something I will tell you what action that would be and what rules would govern that.</p><a href=#starfinder><h1 id=starfinder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Starfinder</h1></a><a href=#classes-races-and-backgrounds---find-the-one-that-you-like-the-most-and-be-familiar-with-it><h2 id=classes-races-and-backgrounds---find-the-one-that-you-like-the-most-and-be-familiar-with-it><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Classes, Races, and Backgrounds - Find the one that you like the most and be familiar with it.</h2></a><p>For the most part, all classes, races, and backgrounds in Starfinder or its supplements are acceptable. If it is a race thatâ€™s particularly wild, like a floating brain in a jar, I might say no to it or try to work with you to fit it into the setting better.</p><a href=#skills---after-you-make-your-character-and-decide-on-what-your-main-skills-are-going-to-be-read-through-what-actions-you-can-take-using-those-actions><h2 id=skills---after-you-make-your-character-and-decide-on-what-your-main-skills-are-going-to-be-read-through-what-actions-you-can-take-using-those-actions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Skills - After you make your character and decide on what your main skills are going to be, read through what actions you can take using those actions</h2></a><p>Skills can be used for specific defined actions much more than DnD, so you might want to read through this section to get an idea of what you can do with them.</p><p><strong>Take 10 and Take 20:</strong> The Take 10 and Take 20 rules in Starfinder are interesting and I like the idea of including them in the game, but it will be dependent on the players to remember and ask during the game if they are able to do them.</p><a href=#feats---read-through-the-table-of-what-the-available-feats-are><h2 id=feats---read-through-the-table-of-what-the-available-feats-are><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Feats - Read through the table of what the available feats are</h2></a><p>Feats are extra moves/tools your character can have. The table starting on page 152 gives a good overview of all of them without making you read through each one in detail. A lot are pretty specific to combat, and this is where you specialize in specific weapons.</p><a href=#equipment---you-dont-have-to-read-through-the-equipment-unless-you-want-to-at-first-stores-will-be-provided-to-you-with-tables-of-what-you-can-buy-when-they-become-available><h2 id=equipment---you-dont-have-to-read-through-the-equipment-unless-you-want-to-at-first-stores-will-be-provided-to-you-with-tables-of-what-you-can-buy-when-they-become-available><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Equipment - You don&rsquo;t have to read through the equipment unless you want to at first, stores will be provided to you with tables of what you can buy when they become available.</h2></a><p>Equipment will be from Starfinder and match its prices.</p><a href=#currency><h3 id=currency><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Currency</h3></a><p>For the most part credits will be used, though the lore behind them will probably match Stars Without Number more than Starfinder.</p><a href=#carrying-capacity---read-the-section-on-carrying-capacity><h3 id=carrying-capacity---read-the-section-on-carrying-capacity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Carrying Capacity - Read the section on Carrying Capacity.</h3></a><p>We will use the carrying capacity rules from Starfinder.</p><a href=#tactical-rules---other-than-your-character-class-you-should-at-least-skim-the-tactical-rules-section-as-these-dictate-what-you-can-do-in-combat><h2 id=tactical-rules---other-than-your-character-class-you-should-at-least-skim-the-tactical-rules-section-as-these-dictate-what-you-can-do-in-combat><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Tactical Rules - Other than your character class, you should at least skim the tactical rules section as these dictate what you can do in combat</h2></a><a href=#conditions><h3 id=conditions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conditions</h3></a><p>There are a lot of conditions in Starfinder, this table is a good reference for what they are.</p><a href=#reputation-system><h1 id=reputation-system><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Reputation system</h1></a><p>As you do jobs for the <a class="internal-link broken">Federation</a> or the <a class="internal-link broken">The Poleus Bloc</a> or their proxy states, you will earn reputation. Conversely, the <a class="internal-link broken">Federation</a> and the <a class="internal-link broken">The Poleus Bloc</a> generally do not appreciate you working with the other entity, and doing so may end up hurting your reputation. Increased reputation with one will give you access to more resources only that entity has access to, higher paying jobs, and potentially even more. Each job will have a reputation bonus associated with it if completed successfully, and a potential reputation hit that you may be able to mitigate during the contract. Be careful though, there may be hidden penalties for failing a contract. The overall state of reputation, which will act as the reputation of <a class="internal-link broken">Tiandi</a> as a whole, will be updated and displayed in the Khalipso Sector section.</p><p>The Federation of United Planets and the Poleus Bloc control a vast majority of the production, equipment, and starships in the sector. However, each superpower has distinct strengths and weaknesses in their production which will determine what is available to you at each reputation tier. I will be posting tables of what the different superpowers make and at which tiers what type of equipment/starships/upgrades you will be able to buy in Terminus. This doesn&rsquo;t mean you cannot gain access to these things if you don&rsquo;t have the reputation necessary, it will just be more difficult and you will have to go somewhere to get it.</p><p>Current reputation for the <a class="internal-link broken">Federation</a>: -25 Wanted Criminals</p><p>Current reputation for the <a class="internal-link broken">The Poleus Bloc</a>: -5 Undocumented</p><ul><li><p>Public Enemy #1 (-40 to -31): Association of any sort with you will be considered illegal. Your likeness will be instantly recognizable by authorities and most individuals. Authorities will have shoot on site orders, and civilians will immediately contact authorities if you are recognized. No one trying to operate at least somewhat legally will offer you contracts willingly, and even black market traders won&rsquo;t operate in <a class="internal-link broken">Terminus</a>.</p></li><li><p>High Priority Targets (-30 to 21): Knowingly assisting you can get people in trouble. Authorities will have a high chance of recognizing you after a period of time, and civilians will have a low chance. Authorities will try to arrest, but resistance may be met with lethal force quickly. Only the most desperate or highly illegal contracts will be offered to you and <a class="internal-link broken">Tiandi</a> won&rsquo;t have access to the standard system wide contract board. Only black market traders will set up shop in Terminus, and will have high markups.</p></li><li><p>Wanted Criminals (-20 to -11): Association with you is not illegal, however it is frowned upon and discouraged. Authorities will have a low chance of recognizing you by appearance, but any papers/registration, scanners, or your transponder on your ship will trip security immediately. Civilians will not recognize you. <a class="internal-link broken">Tiandi</a> will still have access to the standard contract board. Terminus will have black market traders with lower markups.</p></li><li><p>Undocumented (-10 to 0): You do not have an official status. Authorities will not recognize you, however you will show up as undocumented on their systems and not allowed access to things that require documentation. Tiandi will have access to the standard contract board. Both the black market and lower tier shops will set up in Terminus.</p></li><li><p>Established Relations (1 to 10): Tiandi will be recognized as an independent organization, and allowed limited access to things that require documentation. You will have access to the standard contract board as well as the documented only contracts. Terminus will gain some official shops.</p></li><li><p>Preferred Treatment (11 to 20): You will gain preferred treatment status, indicating you are a reputable mercenary and adventuring group trusted to carry out contracts professionally. Tiandi will have preferred access to the standard contract board, with a modest markup to the prices they can charge. The government will set up official shipping channels to Terminus.</p></li><li><p>Citizen-Level Access (21-30): Terminus will gain proxy state status, and have access to everything citizens can. Tiandi will have preferred access to the standard contract board, and higher markup to the prices they can charge. All restrictions on official shops in Terminus will be lifted, and tariffs will be lifted.</p></li><li><p>Licensed Mercenaries/Adventurers (31-40): Tiandi will gain an official mercenary license from the government. You will have access to the military contract board. Some military grade equipment may be available to be purchased.</p></li><li><p>Military Access (41-50): Tiandi will be treated as an official militia. You will have access to all contracts on the standard and military contract boards, and any equipment available to the military is available for purchase. This tier does come with the requirement of answering calls to arms, where failing to come to an official call will result in a revoking of the mercenary license and dropping down to Preferred Treatment.</p></li></ul></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/js/graph.afdb02e537635f9a611b53a988e5645b.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Jacky Zhao using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, Â© 2022</p><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/_jzhao>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
