There are several races in the main book, and 4 alien archive expansion books, you can find those in the rules channel. This website has all the playable races: https://aonsrd.com/Races.aspx?ItemName=All\n\t1. Example: HADROGAAN from alien archive 4. Luma Hadrogaans get +2 WIS, +2 INT, and -2 CON. They also get blindsense (vibration), which is put on the character sheet is under the attributes tab on the right side under Size/Key Ability Score.\n2. Pick a theme. Mostly for background for your character, at first level they give you a +1 to an ability score and specific knowledge. \n\t1. Example: Priest. Gives +1 WIS and theme knowledge of a diety or philosophy. This reduces the DC of Culture and Mysticism checks to recall knowledge about religious traditions, religious symbols, and famous religious leaders by 5. Mysticism becomes a class skill.\n3. Choose a class. On the character sheet, it is under the Features tab. All playable classes: https://www.starjammersrd.com/classes/\n\t1. Example: Mystic. Wisdom becomes the key ability score.\n4. Buy ability scores.\n\t1. Start with a score of 10 in each ability\n\t2. Add and subtract points for race/theme (+2 WIS, +1 WIS, +2 INT, -2 CON)\n\t3. Spend 10 points customizing your scores\n\t4. Record ability scores and ability modifiers\n\t ![[Pasted image 20220213202329.png]]\n5. Apply your class\n6. Hit points: At 1st level, you gain the number of Hit Points listed in your race entry + the number of Hit Points listed in your class‚Äôs description\n7. Your Stamina Points are determined by your Constitution score and your class. At each level, you gain a number of Stamina Points equal to the SP value listed in your class description + your Constitution modifier\n8. Resolve Points: You have a number of Resolve Points equal to half your character level (rounded down, but minimum 1) + the modifier of your key ability score\n9. Assign skill ranks and choose feats\n10. Alignment: You do not need to fill in alignment unless you want to, or you are playing a character with a specific requirement for alignment in their class (like a patron god or something).\n11. Armor class: Energy Energy Armor Class (EAC) and Kinetic Armor Class (KAC) represent how difficult your character is to hit in combat. The values for EAC and KAC each begin at 10. Add your character‚Äôs Dexterity modifier to each value. Then add the EAC bonus and KAC bonus that her armor provides to the respective values. You‚Äôll also want to note your character‚Äôs Armor Class against combat maneuvers, which is her KAC + 8.\n12. You noted your character‚Äôs base attack bonus in Step 6, but you still need to calculate her total attack bonuses with melee, ranged, and thrown weapons. To do so, add her Strength modifier to her melee and thrown attacks, and add her Dexterity modifier to her other ranged attacks. Then add any miscellaneous modifiers from feats or class features to the appropriate attacks.","lastmodified":"2022-06-10T17:33:41.464450948Z","tags":null},"/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/Factions/Alcippe-resistance-movement":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2022-06-10T17:33:41.464450948Z","tags":null},"/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/Factions/Eberswalde":{"title":"","content":"The intelligence service of the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. \n\n## Crimson Tide\n\nA front organization for Eberswalde.

You shall find your payment included in this message. Your next target is [[Lero Bek]], an important figure in the Ministry of the Magitech Industry for the Poleus Bloc. Lero is a top administrator and negotiator who has risen to prominence precipitously, striking several important deals with planets securing access to the natural resources supplying the Bloc's booming Magitech industry. He has also reformed several of the industrial plants producing this Magitech, increasing efficiency by 10% while raising wages and benefits. He is well beloved in the Bloc, and poised to become a powerful political figure. However, we have reason to believe he has ulterior motives and has an aggressive stance towards the Federation, and if he were to come to power would jeopardize aspects of Federation Magitech industry. \n\nUnfortunately, we have precious little information on his personal life. What we do know is this: his home planet is Thucala, and we have reason to believe he is working with the smuggling ring [[Fyre Syndicate]]. He is apparently attending frequent clandestine meetings with the Syndicate leaders, however we do not know the nature of what is being discussed. Your assignment is to investigate Lero Bek and his connections, find him and eliminate him. Your payment will be 10,0000 credits, paid out upon confirmed death of Lero Bek.

A city built on top of and within the remnants of an ancient [[Terran Mandate]] city. This gives the city a unique aesthetic: modern/sci-fi looking buildings and skyscrapers dominate the majority of the skyline, but nestled between them are much older buildings of intricate stonework, metalwork, and gothic stylings that stick out strikingly in the city. There are also a few of these stone buildings that are massive while retaining the artistry, feats of civic engineering and focus not seen for centuries. \n\nDescription for players:\n\n`As you fly down to the city of Koblenz, a city appears near the coast of one of the seas. A modestly large city, housing maybe a million inhabitants, it makes an unmistakable impression. Modern Federation style buildings and skyscrapers dominate a majority of the space, with their sleek glass and steel frames and clean angular faces. However, what draws your attention are the other type of structure nestled between the modern chic throughout the city: ancient buildings of intricate stonework and metal, they stick out strikingly in between the newer construction. Buildings built centuries ago by the Terran Mandate, all are much more ornately designed than the rest of the city. Two of these grab your attention more than others: a massive wall that surrounds a majority of the city, and a massive building sitting on top of a hill next to the shipyards. It has a central building with a tapered roof, with two towers jutting up higher than anything else in the city. It is obviously more ornate than even the other Mandate buildings, with a massive number of buttresses, statues, and other detailing covering its surface.`\n\n## Sanctum Bundesarchiv\n\nA massive archive built by the [[Sector Information#Terran Mandate|Terran Mandate]] underground in a massive cavern. The full schematics and functioning of it have been lost to time, and no one really understands the full extent of its capabilities. The Federation regularly sends in squads to try and map out the archive, but it is dangerous, slow going, and doesn't have a lot of political support. The archive rooms are constantly shifting, and whole rooms can be lost in the bowels of the archive. Servitors patrol the archives and make sure no one messes with the archives. \n\nMany of the archives are stored on parchment/other non-digital media for magical information that cannot be stored digitally. The archives are in use because the rooms are shifted down when not in use and put into a stasis that stops the flow of time and cancel out any magical effects, making it impossible for anything to be taken out of the archives if it can't be retrieved by the servitors. Only the mechanics of the archives can get things out of the stasis. \n\n## Potential Locations\n\n### Nchak Ascendancy Embassy\n\nThe embassy of the [[Nchak Ascendancy]] in the [[The Federation of United Planets]]. A small round building that the Trox work out of to lobby the Federation against take overs of the sector and against war with the [[The Poleus Bloc]]. Has one main ambassador: [[Hugo Clark]]. \n\n### Altenkirchen\n\nBusy downtown of Koblenz, mostly newer construction and neon. What it would have: shops, less reputable members of society.\n\n### Mondbridge\n\nHigher class neighborhood. What it will have: houses of some of the upper levels of society, potentially someone who works in the archives.\n\n### Schweine\n\nThe slums of the city, close to the industrial sector and also around the river. Does a lot of fishing, bars, things of that nature. What it would have: The hideout of the main gang in the city.\n\n### Sektor Industrium\n\nThe section of the city with all of the industrial plants. \n\n### Hei√üer Park/Heer Millitarum\n\nThe part of the city with all of the capitol buildings, government buildings, and the military offices. \n\n### Koblenz Historical Society\n\nYou find it in the Steinweg section of the city, hear the western wall.

The Shard is a massive [[math drive]], 100x larger than the two known math drives in the sector. It put out an immense amount of energy, enough to power just about anything you could think of. However, most technology and power transfer systems just break and short out under the load of trying to take that energy and put it out into something useful. He was using the opposing polarities of Solarians to manipulate the flow of time around the Shard, allowing energy to flow out slow enough to be useable. \n\n[[Bosch]]'s theory about how they work is that they are entropy accelerators that accept  information and output energy and random noise. In the last few months though, he has felt the nagging feeling that there was something in that random noise, he felt like when looked at the output from the math drive sometimes it appeared as if there was some intention behind the noise. He does not know what the passing out was, he expects it happened as [[Qusari]] was there to throw off the Solarian balance.

In combat, Demitra‚Äôs strength lies in her willingness to adapt on the fly and be a useful distraction for her compatriots to succeed. Whenever she‚Äôs not out on a gig, she‚Äôs known for being glued to multiple screamsheets and datapads that relate to her parents‚Äô death. Or, she can be found tinkering with her signature gulch gun and gadgets, prepping for her next foray in the Khalipso Sector.\n\n**PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION**\n\nShe‚Äôs about 5‚Äô11‚Äù with a lean muscular build and warm freckled skin. She has some small tattoos dappled along her body, most notably of which is a flaming skull that rests on her lower stomach near her left hip.

So, she tends to keep a very neutral position around people that‚Äôs not in her inner circle and tends to stay focused on the task at hand.\n\nThose who get close to her, begin to see a woman who‚Äôs a living fountain of information. She‚Äôs seems to have a fun fact or anecdote on a myriad of topics, granted most have a tough time discerning if the stories she tells are true or grand fabrications. And she tends to always be looking forward to the next job.\n\n**HISTORY**\n\nDemitra is the daughter of two brilliant well-known engineers in the Federation named Lukas and Tessa DeMarco. Her childhood barely knew strife as her small family lived in a rich corner of the Khalipso Sector. However, her life would take a turn for the worse after discovering one day that her parents were brutally murdered by an unknown assailant.\n\nPromptly adopted by her uncle, Viceroy Valentine, the duo quickly fled, fearing the possibility of either of them being potential targets for the killer. Once settled in the shadier parts of the Khalipso Sector, Viceroy polished off his old mercenary gear and got to work finding who killed Demitra‚Äôs parents. This left Demitra alone on many nights to grieve and come to terms with her parents passing.\n\nAfter a few years of stubborn persistence from Demitra, Viceroy began to teach her how to operate as an ‚Äúindependent contractor‚Äù within the Khalipso Sector. When she came of age, Viceroy took her out on her first few gigs to truly test her mettle. And she rose to the occasion and excelled, using her charm and cool head to complete most of her gigs. The two then took to the Sector, taking on gigs to keep their cramped starship afloat and fund their investigation.\n\nHowever, age eventually caught up with Viceroy and he decided to retire the mercenary work to Demitra while he continued the search for the killer via his remote channels and contacts. Meanwhile, Demitra decided to venture out in the Sector, taking riskier jobs to expand her fame and gain the attention of potential allies that could help.\n\nHer most recent job involved her intermingling with a notorious crimelord named Xero. Xero‚Äôs son, Lobos, has recently been imprisoned after a job gone bad and needs Demitra‚Äôs services to protect him from harm. With help from Xero, a plan was set in motion to send Demitra to prison under false charges to keep Lobos alive. However, the processing stage of Demitra‚Äôs imprisonment took too long, and Lobos was already dead upon her arrival to the prison. With no gig and Xero going radio silent after the discovery of his son‚Äôs death, Demitra will be wallowing in prison until her false sentence is up.","lastmodified":"2022-06-10T17:33:41.468450951Z","tags":null},"/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/PCs/Jean-Pierre":{"title":"","content":"Quest\n\nAn archeologist, was arrested for stealing an artifact.","lastmodified":"2022-06-10T17:33:41.468450951Z","tags":null},"/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/PCs/Lutri":{"title":"","content":"Devin\n\n# Background\nLutri is a famed lawyer renowned for his defense of Lemonade Sampson and largely for a quote in the case of the murder of the mermodels, the disgruntled human √ó-husband allegedly left a flipper at the underwater home of his x-wife's new girlfriend (among many other details) but as part of his defense, Lutri made him try it on.

The base form of your solar manifestation, when not actively in use, is a mote of stellar energy slightly smaller than your fist that hovers near your head. Beyond the solar mote, your manifestation can take one of two additional forms: armor or a weapon. You must pick one solar manifestation (either armor or a weapon) upon taking your first level of solarian. You also choose whether your solar manifestation (in any form) either glows brightly with one color common to stars (including blue, red, white, or yellow) or is the perfect darkness of a black hole. A glowing solar manifestation, regardless of its form, sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius. You can shut off the light or darkness as a standard action in order to blend in or assist in stealth, but whenever you enter a stellar mode (see page 102), the glow or darkness returns immediately. Once made, these choices cannot be changed.\nOnly you can interact with your solar manifestation, whether in mote, armor, or weapon form. No other creature or effect can affect your solar manifestation in any way, including disarming or sundering it.\n\n### Solar Armor\n\nYour solar armor grants you a +1 enhancement bonus to both your Kinetic Armor Class and your Energy Armor Class. This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level. It is compatible with light armor, but it gives you no benefit if you‚Äôre wearing heavy armor. At 5th level, you also gain energy resistance 5 while your solar armor is active. You can choose either cold resistance or fire resistance when you activate the armor, and can switch energy types as a move action. This energy resistance increases by 5 at 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter.\nForming or dismissing solar armor is a move action.\n\n### Solar Weapon\n\nYour solar weapon functions as a one-handed kinetic advanced melee weapon, and you‚Äôre automatically proficient with it. At 1st level, choose whether your solar weapon deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can change the damage type each time you gain a new solarian level. Your solar weapon deals damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level, 9th level, 12th level, and every level thereafter. Solarian weapon crystals (see page 170) can increase your solar weapon‚Äôs damage.\nForming or dismissing a solar weapon is a move action that takes the same amount of effort as drawing or sheathing a weapon (and can be combined with a move as a single move action or used with the Quick Draw feat). Your solar weapon is automatically dismissed if it ever leaves your hand.\n\n## Stellar Mode\n\n- At the start of your first turn in combat, if you are conscious, you must choose one of three stellar modes: graviton, photon, or unattuned (see below).\n\t- At the start of each subsequent turn of combat, you must choose to either stay in your current stellar mode or to become unattuned. If you choose to stay in your mode, you gain another attunement point for that mode. As long as you have 1 or 2 attunement points in a mode, you are attuned to that mode. Once you reach 3 attunement points in a mode, you become fully attuned to that mode. Some of your stellar revelations are zenith revelations, which can be used only when you‚Äôre fully attuned to one mode or the other. When you are fully attuned, you cannot gain more points in your mode, but you stay fully attuned until combat ends, your stellar mode ends, or you become unattuned. If you choose to become unattuned, you lose all attunement points you‚Äôve accrued so far. At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.\n\t- At the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends. If you are not in a stellar mode, for any reason, you are considered unattuned for the purposes of your stellar revelations.\n\t- When you‚Äôre not in combat, you can‚Äôt enter a stellar mode. This ability manifests only in high-stakes situations, when your training takes over and connects your mind to the universe. There needs to be some risk to you for your stellar mode to activate, so you must be facing a significant enemy (see page 242). If there‚Äôs any doubt about whether you‚Äôre in combat or able to access your stellar mode, the GM decides. This also means that your stellar mode might end before what was previously a dangerous battle is over, once all that remains are dregs that don‚Äôt pose a real threat to you.\n\n### Graviton Mode\n\nWhile graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.\n\n### Photon Mode\n\nWhile photon-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to damage rolls (including damage rolls for your stellar powers). This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have.\n\n### Unattuned\n\nNo benefits\n\n## STELLAR REVELATION\n\nStellar revelations normally note what kind of action they require. If a stellar revelation does not note the kind of action it takes and it modifies some other action (such as an attack or skill check), it can be used as part of that action. If a stellar revelation allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your solarian level + your Charisma modifier. A revelation that says it lasts for 1 round or until you leave the associated mode lasts for whichever of these durations is longer. You can use stellar revelations both in and out of combat, but since you can‚Äôt enter a stellar mode outside of battle, any revelation that lasts for 1 round or as long as you‚Äôre in a stellar mode lasts only 1 round if you‚Äôre not in combat.\n\n### Black Hole \n\nWhen you‚Äôre fully graviton-attuned, as a standard action, you can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet of you closer. You choose which creatures are affected and which ones aren‚Äôt. Each target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be pulled 10 feet toward you. The range of this revelation and the distance pulled increase by 5 feet at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Solid objects do not block this ability, but any creature that runs into a solid object ceases moving closer to you. Creatures moved by this ability do not provoke attacks of opportunity from this movement. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Black hole functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.\n\n### Supernova\n\nWhen you‚Äôre fully photon-attuned, as a standard action, you can deal 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 additional fire damage per solarian level to all creatures within 10 feet of you. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage. At 9th level, you can increase the radius to 15 feet, and at 17th level, you can increase the radius to 20 feet. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Supernova functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.\n\n# Race: Reptoid\n\n## Size: Medium Humanoid\n\n## Change Shape\n\nOnce per day, a reptoid can assume the appearance of a specific single Medium humanoid. The reptoid always takes this specific form when using this ability. The reptoid gains a +10 racial bonus to Disguise checks to appear as that type of humanoid. This ability otherwise functions as per disguise self, and lasts for 10 minutes √ó the reptoid‚Äôs character level. A reptoid can select a new humanoid form by spending 1 week preparing for the change, but can then no longer assume the previous form.\n\n## Cold blooded\n\nReptoids receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects and poisons.\n\n## Natural weapons\n\nReptoids are always considered to be armed when they are not using their change shape ability. They can deal 1d3 lethal slashing damage with unarmed strikes, and the attack does not count as archaic. Reptoids gain a unique weapon specialization with their natural weapons at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1-1/2 √ó their character level to their damage rolls for their natural weapons (instead of adding just their character level, as usual).","lastmodified":"2022-06-10T17:33:41.468450951Z","tags":null},"/Khalipso/Stars-Without-Number/Rules":{"title":"","content":"![[StarsWithoutNumberRevised-DeluxeEdition-011418_(32633169).pdf]]\n\n# Overview\nThis campaign will use a combination of Stars Without Number and Starfinder rpg rules. For the most part, Starfinder will be the dominant game we will be using. Starfinder is based off of Pathfinder, and is somewhat similar in mechanics to DnD. However, we will be disregarding most of the lore from Starfinder and using Stars Without Number for the world and lore. This might be a little wonky, so if there is specific lore that you read in Starfinder that you think would be important to your character let me know and we can probably work it into the setting.\n\nSome notes about the rules from the games below. Starfinder is a particularly dense book to get through, so I will try to highlight the things I think you should at least look at. I will do my best to guide you through the rules in the first sessions, but there are a *lot* of actions you can take as a PC that you might want to keep in mind since it is not feasible for me to remind you of all of them. HOWEVER I like having players just try to play a character as naturally as they like without worrying beforehand what specific actions the rules dictate you can take, so if you feel like you can be pretty inventive with your actions and don't just need a list of actions you can take, feel free to be more freeform with it and as we go we can map your actions onto specific rules/actions from the book. Starfinder seems to be pretty good at providing rules for doing most anything you can think of, so if you say you want to do something I will tell you what action that would be and what rules would govern that. \n\n# Starfinder\n\n## Classes, Races, and Backgrounds - Find the one that you like the most and be familiar with it. \nFor the most part, all classes, races, and backgrounds in Starfinder or its supplements are acceptable. If it is a race that‚Äôs particularly wild, like a floating brain in a jar, I might say no to it or try to work with you to fit it into the setting better. \n\n## Skills - After you make your character and decide on what your main skills are going to be, read through what actions you can take using those actions\n\nSkills can be used for specific defined actions much more than DnD, so you might want to read through this section to get an idea of what you can do with them.\n\n**Take 10 and Take 20:** The Take 10 and Take 20 rules in Starfinder are interesting and I like the idea of including them in the game, but it will be dependent on the players to remember and ask during the game if they are able to do them.\n\n## Feats - Read through the table of what the available feats are\nFeats are extra moves/tools your character can have. The table starting on page 152 gives a good overview of all of them without making you read through each one in detail. A lot are pretty specific to combat, and this is where you specialize in specific weapons. \n\n## Equipment - You don't have to read through the equipment unless you want to at first, stores will be provided to you with tables of what you can buy when they become available. \nEquipment will be from Starfinder and match its prices.\n\n### Currency\nFor the most part credits will be used, though the lore behind them will probably match Stars Without Number more than Starfinder. \n\n### Carrying Capacity - Read the section on Carrying Capacity.\nWe will use the carrying capacity rules from Starfinder. \n\n## Tactical Rules - Other than your character class, you should at least skim the tactical rules section as these dictate what you can do in combat\n\n### Conditions\nThere are a lot of conditions in Starfinder, this table is a good reference for what they are. \n\n\n# Reputation system\n\nAs you do jobs for the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] or the [[The Poleus Bloc]] or their proxy states, you will earn reputation. Conversely, the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] and the [[The Poleus Bloc]] generally do not appreciate you working with the other entity, and doing so may end up hurting your reputation. Increased reputation with one will give you access to more resources only that entity has access to, higher paying jobs, and potentially even more. Each job will have a reputation bonus associated with it if completed successfully, and a potential reputation hit that you may be able to mitigate during the contract. Be careful though, there may be hidden penalties for failing a contract. The overall state of reputation, which will act as the reputation of [[Tiandi]] as a whole, will be updated and displayed in the Khalipso Sector section. \n\nThe Federation of United Planets and the Poleus Bloc control a vast majority of the production, equipment, and starships in the sector. However, each superpower has distinct strengths and weaknesses in their production which will determine what is available to you at each reputation tier. I will be posting tables of what the different superpowers make and at which tiers what type of equipment/starships/upgrades you will be able to buy in Terminus. This doesn't mean you cannot gain access to these things if you don't have the reputation necessary, it will just be more difficult and you will have to go somewhere to get it.\n\nCurrent reputation for the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]: -25 Wanted Criminals\n\nCurrent reputation for the [[The Poleus Bloc]]: -5 Undocumented\n\n- Public Enemy #1 (-40 to -31): Association of any sort with you will be considered illegal. Your likeness will be instantly recognizable by authorities and most individuals. Authorities will have shoot on site orders, and civilians will immediately contact authorities if you are recognized. No one trying to operate at least somewhat legally will offer you contracts willingly, and even black market traders won't operate in [[Terminus]].\n\n- High Priority Targets (-30 to 21): Knowingly assisting you can get people in trouble. Authorities will have a high chance of recognizing you after a period of time, and civilians will have a low chance. Authorities will try to arrest, but resistance may be met with lethal force quickly. Only the most desperate or highly illegal contracts will be offered to you and [[Tiandi]] won't have access to the standard system wide contract board. Only black market traders will set up shop in Terminus, and will have high markups. \n\n- Wanted Criminals (-20 to -11): Association with you is not illegal, however it is frowned upon and discouraged. Authorities will have a low chance of recognizing you by appearance, but any papers/registration, scanners, or your transponder on your ship will trip security immediately. Civilians will not recognize you. [[Tiandi]] will still have access to the standard contract board. Terminus will have black market traders with lower markups.\n\n- Undocumented (-10 to 0): You do not have an official status. Authorities will not recognize you, however you will show up as undocumented on their systems and not allowed access to things that require documentation. Tiandi will have access to the standard contract board. Both the black market and lower tier shops will set up in Terminus. \n\n- Established Relations (1 to 10): Tiandi will be recognized as an independent organization, and allowed limited access to things that require documentation. You will have access to the standard contract board as well as the documented only contracts. Terminus will gain some official shops.\n\n- Preferred Treatment (11 to 20): You will gain preferred treatment status, indicating you are a reputable mercenary and adventuring group trusted to carry out contracts professionally. Tiandi will have preferred access to the standard contract board, with a modest markup to the prices they can charge. The government will set up official shipping channels to Terminus. \n\n- Citizen-Level Access (21-30): Terminus will gain proxy state status, and have access to everything citizens can. Tiandi will have preferred access to the standard contract board, and higher markup to the prices they can charge. All restrictions on official shops in Terminus will be lifted, and tariffs will be lifted.\n\n- Licensed Mercenaries/Adventurers (31-40): Tiandi will gain an official mercenary license from the government. You will have access to the military contract board. Some military grade equipment may be available to be purchased.\n\n- Military Access (41-50): Tiandi will be treated as an official militia. You will have access to all contracts on the standard and military contract boards, and any equipment available to the military is available for purchase. This tier does come with the requirement of answering calls to arms, where failing to come to an official call will result in a revoking of the mercenary license and dropping down to Preferred Treatment.

The sector quickly became dependent on these drives for energy, before it was discovered that these drives work in tandem across any amount of space, and deactivating one deactivates them all. This established a method of mutual destruction that prevented the Federation and the Bloc from waging all out war on each other.\n\nSince the start of the conflict, a majority of planets/systems in the sector have become ‚Äúofficially‚Äù part of the FUP or Bloc, but most planets retain their autonomy and the superpowers‚Äô governmental presence on these planets is minimal. \n\nThe Federation and the Bloc constantly vie for superiority using espionage, proxy wars, and accumulation of pre-scream artifacts and technology. Many of these jobs have been contracted out to adventurers, pirates, and other individuals who have no particular alliance but will work for anyone's money. \n\nThis delicate balance has just been upset by an incursion of cosmic horror from a corner of the sector always considered wild space and impossible to traverse. \n\n## History\n\n### Terran Mandate\n\nThe old empire of Earth that controlled the majority of the galaxy.

This can only occur if there is a receiver at the end. Generally considered unsecure, but easier to accomplish\n- General message transport: Messages are sent to a relay that then send them to traveling ships to the desired sector. When arriving at the new sector, messages are automatically sent to the relay in the hex. Much quicker than light speed, and generally more secure as the messages are encrypted. Travels at 1 hex/day. However, ships are not screened. A more secure version uses only registered messenger ships that travels slower at 2 days/hex. \n- Quantum-entangled comm units: Extremely expensive gear that allow instantaneous completely secure messaging between two quantum entangles comm units. Only the Terran Mandate was able to make these, so they are very hard to find.\n- Magical means.\n\n# [[Tiandi]]\n\nThe mercenary company that provides the contracts and home base for the player characters.

Humanity spread across the stars from Earth, finding many worlds to inhabit and many alien species to interact with. At some point, a psychic event called the Scream covered the entire galaxy, shutting down all space travel. Both spike drives, the technological method used by the majority, as well as magical/psychic methods of travel were completely prevented by the Scream. Only relatively recently, within the past 2-3 centuries, have sentient species rediscovered spike-drive technology and been able to conjur magic that allows travel between worlds. Travel has still been fairly tentative and slow, and small pockets of the galaxy have begun to interact with their stellar neighbors. Our campaign will take place in one relatively large sector of connected space, known to a slim majority of locals as the Kalipso sector. Two planets in this sector developed inter-system space travel around the same time, 300ish years ago, have been exploring and concentrating power for a considerable amount of time. These two planets, Thorhil and Poleus, have formed large superpowers in the sector and have fallen into a cold war with each other that dominates the political landscape of the sector. However, they have far from a firm grasp on most systems, with some planets in Kalipso not even aware of these planetary squabbles.**\n\nIntro into the rules:\n- **The vast majority of the rules for this campaign will come from Starfinder. All your character creation, progression, items, and general play rules will be from Starfinder. There are two exceptions; traveling between planets will use Stars without Number rules, and there will be a faction system that you all won't need to worry about at first from Stars without Number. The starships themselves, upgrading them, purchasing them, and the rules for starship combat will be from Starfinder. The faction system is something that if people are interested in interacting with it, I would like to have that become a part of what you do fairly early on, but if that doesn't interest you at all you don't ever have to interact with it.**\n- **Character creation will come from Starfinder, which we can go through today if you want. I have posted all of the races and classes you can be in the rules chat, and you can go through them. Since this isn't the Starfinder rules, some of the background lore around the character creation might be different, but that'll have to be case-by-case. I would also discourage you from taking the wackiest races, such as the Contemplative, which is just a floating brain, but if you really want to we can try to work something out.**\n\nFirst session\n- **The first session will start out in a prison, with all the player characters being locked up by the Thorhil government for some reason, so if you want to be part of the first session try to think up some reason your character would be in prison.

We are playing in the Stars without number universe mostly, so I'll give a brief introduction and backstory. Hundreds of years ago, most of the galaxy was connected through metadimensional travel, either through the use of science like spike drives and Jump Gates, or through magical means that are too numerous to count but usually much more volatile. One day, a massive wave of metadimensional energy ripped through the entirety of the galaxy, completely destroying spike drives, jump gates, and any psychics currently connected to the warp. This event, later called \"the Scream\", was followed by a period of disconnection, scientific atrophy, and loss of communication as the Warp and all other dimensions became inaccessible for close to 600 years. Gradually, all these disconnected planets have begun taking to the stars again in the hopes of regaining the glory of the pre-scream stellar empires. \n\nYou all are in the the Kalipso sector! A large chunk of connected space still expanding, connecting, and exploring all of the worlds within its reach. It is currently embroiled in a decades long power struggle between two interstellar superpowers, the Federation of United Planets and the Poleus Bloc. For 60 years, these two superpowers have been been vying for galactic supremacy through espionage, research, and proxy wars.  \n\t\nHowever, none of you probably care much about all of that right now. You all are currently on a prison transport craft, being shuttled from whatever local jailhouse on whatever local planet to you were previously on after being picked up one by one as the ship makes its circuitous journey. One of the guards traveling with you on this journey has informed you that you (5/6) are lucky enough to be guests at the Shard, something most of you probably haven't heard of before. You all, however, are just overflow from around the Federation, and the Shard apparently has plenty of extra room.\n\nYou (5/6) are seated across from each other in the back of the shuttle. Hands cuffed in front of you, feet bound in shackles, and those with magical powers have collars around your necks that are dampening your powers. There is one other prisoner in here with you all, a scrawny looking Vesk ([[Julius]]) sitting next you [[Amos]]. The back of the shuttle is an airlock, towards the from is a locked door that presumably leads to the rest of the ship and the cockpit. There was another prisoner, a small green and red hobgoblin that was the last stop the shuttle did before making towards your new home, but the guards took him deeper into the ship leaving you inmates here by yourselves. \n\nSo, let's go around and introduce the characters, what they look like and what kinda vibes you putting out there. \n\n# Play part 1\n\nThe journey is going to take about ~1 hour, they have an hour to do stuff on the ship before they arrive at the Shard. (This will be about an hour of real time as well as in-game time.) With the cuffs on, you have the Entangled condition (You move at half speed, you cannot run or charge, and you take a ‚Äì2 penalty to your AC, attack rolls, Reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks.)\n\n[[Julius]] in a wiry snivvly accent: \"I shouldn't be here, I didn't do anything! I shouldn't be locked up with these CRIMINALS! I'm just a data analyst!\" and is generally freaking out. At some point he asks why they are all here.\n\n**5 or 4 CR (XP budget of 1,600 or 1,200)**\n\nWant to make it possible but extremely unlikely that they could break out completely right here, but likely enough that they will get out of the holding cell to overhear a conversation that will be useful in breaking out of the prison later. \n\n[[Boomerang]] is on this ship with them, being held in another area because he is considered higher risk due to being from the [[Terminus]] gang. If they encounter him here he will tell them he knows someone on the inside who can get them an emp grenade to help break out if they help him out. \n\n## Encounters\n\n### In the ship\n#### 3 guards (CR 2, 1,800)\n\nXP 600\nHuman soldier\nLN Medium humanoid (human)\nInit +3; Perception +5\n\nDEFENSE\n\nHP 30; EAC 12; KAC 14\nFort +4; Ref +3; Will +3\n\nOFFENSE\n\nSpeed 40 ft.\nMelee carbon Tactical Baton (1d4B;  analog operative)\nRanged Arc pistol (1d6 E; critical Arc 2; Stun)\nOffensive Abilities fighting style (blitz)\n\nTACTICS\n\nDuring Combat A guard officer tries to close with any threats, to put them down as quickly as possible.\n\nMorale A guard officer retreats when reduced to 5 HP or fewer.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nStr +3; Dex +0; Con +1; Int -1; Wis +0; Cha +0\nSkills Athletics +5, Intimidate +8, Diplomacy +3, Sense Motive +3\nFeats Cleave, Quick Draw\nLanguages Common\nOther Abilities lay of the land\n\nsquad defiance series armor\n\nSPECIAL ABILITIES\n\nLay of the Land (Ex)\n\nA guard officer can alert other creatures to local customs, traditions, tricks, and suspicious activity, granting a +2 bonus for 24 hours on opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks within the guard officer‚Äôs home area (typically a city, large spaceship, or space station).

The door is locked currently and very hard to open, but the guard outside will let them out without much pushing\n- 1 guard outside the hold \n- A separate hold with a laser door they cannot open that houses [[Boomerang]]\n- A break room for the guards with some food and two tables and stools.\n- Ladders up to the top part of the ship with hatches on the top of them. \n- Top part of the ship has a main hull section with not much in it. \n- Back of the ship contains the engine room with the spike drive. It is flooded with metadimensional energies as it propels the ship through the Warp. There are two blast doors that can't be opened to it. Opening it would flood the ship with the metadimension, killing everyone instantly and destroying the ship.\n- The front is the cockpit, blocked off by those same blast doors.\n- The left room is a storage room with supplies for the prison. There is a lower security locked door to it. \n\t- Unlocked boxes have food supplies in them\n\t- In the locked storage boxes they can find: 3 batons, 2 survival knives, 5 flare guns, and an azimuth lazer pistol for weapons. 8 Estex suits. 500 meters Cable line, titanium alloy. 4 Medpatches. 2 Flashlights. 10 Manacles. 10 Personal Comm units. \n\t\t- 10 boxes.\n- The right room is a sealed off cargo room with their affects. \n### In the cockpit:\n- 2 guard officer (CR 3, XP 1,600)\n\nXP 800\nHuman soldier\nLN Medium humanoid (human)\nInit +5; Perception +8\n\nDEFENSE\n\nHP 40; EAC 14; KAC 16\nFort +5; Ref +3; Will +4\n\nOFFENSE\n\nSpeed 40 ft.\nMelee carbon steel curve blade +11 (1d10+9 S; critical bleed 1d6; analog)\nRanged tactical acid dart rifle +8 (1d8+3 A\u0026 P; critical corrode 1d4; analog) or incendiary grenade 1 +8 (explode 5 ft., 1d6 F, critical 1d4 burn, DC 12)\nOffensive Abilities gear boost (melee striker), fighting style (blitz)\n\nTACTICS\n\nDuring Combat A guard officer tries to close with any threats, to put them down as quickly as possible.\n\nMorale A guard officer retreats when reduced to 15 HP or fewer.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nStr +4; Dex +1; Con +2; Int +0; Wis +0; Cha +0\nSkills Athletics +8, Intimidate +13, Diplomacy +8, Sense Motive +8\nFeats Cleave, Quick Draw\nLanguages Common\nOther Abilities lay of the land\nGear carbon steel curve blade, tactical acid dart rifle with 20 darts, incendiary grenades I (2), squad defiance series armor\n\nSPECIAL ABILITIES\n\nLay of the Land (Ex)\n\nA guard officer can alert other creatures to local customs, traditions, tricks, and suspicious activity, granting a +2 bonus for 24 hours on opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks within the guard officer‚Äôs home area (typically a city, large spaceship, or space station). She can also arrange a meeting with a watch captain.\n\nABOUT\n\nGuard officers supervise guards in their duties and respond to major disturbances, using their grim demeanors and skill at arms to quell conflict. They coordinate well in battle with the guards under their command, rounding up troublemakers and preventing their escape.\n\n\n\n**If they listen in to the officers in the cockpit, they will hear this discussion with the station:**\n\n\"Well how long is this going to take? Yes I know we need to do it, but its going to leave a hole in security the size of gas giant. If someone knocks out the power from the lower decks while you all are retrofitting the electrical systems, its all kapoot. Yes I know its been decided in ... You'll get it done in a day? Fine. Two weeks from now.\" and he stops the com call. \n\n### **Description of the prison**\nThe prison is an old installation, a space station that has been in orbit around the EHGF524074 black hole for longer than the Federation has been around. It could be Mandate tech, however no one really knows. The station itself is a large spike with eight rectangular projections consisting of the prison cells jutting out perpendicular from the center of the spike. A ring surrounds and connects the ends of the cell blocks, and houses all of the guards and administration. The center spike has an upper section, which contains the shipyard where the incoming and outgoing prisoners come through, as well as an impound for the starships from the various prisoners. The very peak of this spike is the warden's office. The lower half of the spike is only reachable through a central elevator, and is the most well guarded part of the prison. You do not know what is down there, but you assume it is where the worst prisoners are kept. \n\n### **Intro for the breakout:**\nFor the past few weeks, you all have banded together to plan a prison break. Currently, you all are gathering in the mess hall to meet up with [[Boomerang]], another inmate, to negotiate for the last piece of the puzzle for your escape plan: an emp grenade smuggled in through various channels you are too low ranking to understand. You see him sitting along at a table, picking at some slop. He notices you all and waves you over.\n\n```\nAsk the players who they are and what they look like as they talk to him. This is the first time they're talking to him, and he wants introductions to all of them. \nConversation with Boomerang: He wants to be taken with the players. He won't give the emp willingly unless they agree to take him, and even if they don't he will end up stowing away on their ship in the chaos.\n```\n\nAfter obtaining the last key component in your plan, you set off to enact your daring escape, and we fade into a flashback of how we got to this point. \n\n\n\n## The Plan\n```\nAfter they get the emp from [[Boomerang]], they can now execute the plan. Coming up with the plan can be done in a series of flashbacks.\n```\n\nAfter a couple minutes, you all hear from the starport side of the door a large crashing sound, followed by shouts of alarm, followed by a loud whining sound of an impulse drive spinning up and an explosion. The guard by the door shouts in \"Damn it what was that. Looks like you all will have to stay in this holding cell a while\" and rushes off towards the crash. You are again left alone, this time with no one to hear you. \n\n`They can find a grating that they can remove and crawl through a vent a couple of meters to above the office of the chief of the guards. At the end of the vent shaft, there are metal bars installed they can't get past.`\n\nOnce in the shaft you hear the chief of staff talking on comms to someone \"Well how long is this going to take? Yes I know we need to do it, but its going to leave a hole in our security the size of gas giant. If someone knocks out the power from the lower decks while you all are retrofitting the electrical systems, its all kapoot. The cells open, all doors unlock, and the automatic defense systems deactivate. All we would have left is the guards, and we're understaffed as it is. Yes I know its been decided in ... You'll get it done in a day? Fine. Two weeks from now.\" and he trails off as you hear noises from the holding cell. `Make a save to get back in time before the guards get back. If they fail, there is a consequence later on.`\n\n## Flashback 2\n```\nIntro into the layout of the prison. This is much more freeform.\n```\n\nIt's been about a week and you all are outside your cells in recreation time. You have all agreed to meet up and come up with a plan for how you will use the information you heard to escape. \n\n`Let them explore and find out what they want.

We are playing in the Stars without number universe mostly, so I'll give a brief introduction and backstory. Hundreds of years ago, most of the galaxy was connected through metadimensional travel, either through the use of science like spike drives and Jump Gates, or through magical means that are too numerous to count but usually much more volatile. One day, a massive wave of metadimensional energy ripped through the entirety of the galaxy, completely destroying spike drives, jump gates, and any psychics currently connected to the warp. This event, later called \"the Scream\", was followed by a period of disconnection, scientific atrophy, and loss of communication as the Warp and all other dimensions became inaccessible for close to 600 years. Gradually, all these disconnected planets have begun taking to the stars again in the hopes of regaining the glory of the pre-scream stellar empires. \n\nYou all are in the the Kalipso sector! A large chunk of connected space still expanding, connecting, and exploring all of the worlds within its reach. It is currently embroiled in a decades long power struggle between two interstellar superpowers, the Federation of United Planets and the Poleus Bloc. For 60 years, these two superpowers have been been vying for galactic supremacy through espionage, research, and proxy wars.  \n\t\nHowever, none of you probably care much about all of that right now. You all are currently on a prison transport craft, being shuttled from whatever local jailhouse on whatever local planet to you were previously on after being picked up one by one as the ship makes its circuitous journey. One of the guards traveling with you has informed you that you all are lucky enough to be guests at the Shard, and then walked off with obviously forced laughter. You all, however, are just overflow from around the Federation, and the Shard apparently has plenty of extra room.\n\nYou are seated across from each other in a holding cell inside the shuttle. Hands cuffed in front of you, feet bound in shackles, and those with magical powers have collars around your necks that are dampening your powers (DC to escape from manacles is 30, DC to break them is 25). You are also harnessed to the seats as the shuttle makes its departure from the planet and prepartions for a spike drive to the shard. There are 3 other prisoners in here with you all, a scrawny looking Vesk ([[Julius]]) sitting between [[Qusari]] and [[Demitra DeMarco]] and another two flanking [[Lutri]].  The ship is currently taking off from its last stop picking up one more prisoner, a small green and red hobgoblin the guards took somewhere else. \n\nEveryone is silent except the scrawny vesk [[Julius]] (The Vesk next to [[Qusari]] and [[Demitra DeMarco]]) who has been muttering under his breath ever since he joined your merry band in a wiry snivvly accent: \"I shouldn't be here, I didn't do anything! I'm not a criminal!\" and is generally freaking out.\n\nSo, let's go around and introduce the characters, what they look like and what kinda vibes you putting out there. \n\nVelloro decides to speak up if none of them do and ask what put them in the slammer. He got busted for fighting in an illegal gladiator battle on his home planet of Fra. \n\n# Play part 1: Transport Ship\n\nYou feel the telltale shudder and slight pickling of skin as the ships spike drive forces the ship into metadimensional space, starting the final leg of the journey. A couple seconds later, the harnesses are released and you are free to stand up and walk about.\n\nThe journey is going to take about ~1 hour, they have an hour to do stuff on the ship before they arrive at the Shard. (This will be about an hour of real time as well as in-game time.) With the cuffs on, you have the Entangled condition (You move at half speed, you cannot run or charge, and you take a ‚Äì2 penalty to your AC, attack rolls, Reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and Dexterity-based skill and ability checks.)\n\n**5 or 4 CR (XP budget of 1,600 or 1,200)**\n\nWant to make it possible but extremely unlikely that they could break out completely right here, but likely enough that they will get out of the holding cell to overhear a conversation that will be useful in breaking out of the prison later. \n\nWhen they leave the room: The rest of the ship is much the same as the room you were just in, extremely sparse and obviously outfitted for one job: transporting prisoners. There are four guards about, most looking extremely bored with one even sleeping in his chair and none take notice of you as you exit. You hear a whispering from down the left hallway.\n\n[[Boomerang]] is on this ship with them, being held in another area because he is considered higher risk due to being from the [[Terminus]] gang (Eos Fortuna). If they encounter him here he will tell them he knows someone on the inside who can get them an emp grenade to help break out if they help him out. \n\n## Encounters\n\n### In the ship\n#### 3 guards (CR 2, 1,800)\n\nXP 600\nHuman soldier\nLN Medium humanoid (human)\nInit +3; Perception +5\n\nDEFENSE\n\nHP 30; EAC 12; KAC 14\nFort +4; Ref +3; Will +3\n\nOFFENSE\n\nSpeed 40 ft.\nMelee carbon Tactical Baton (1d4B;  analog operative)\nRanged Arc pistol (1d6 E; critical Arc 2; Stun)\nOffensive Abilities fighting style (blitz)\n\nTACTICS\n\nDuring Combat A guard officer tries to close with any threats, to put them down as quickly as possible.\n\nMorale A guard officer retreats when reduced to 5 HP or fewer.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nStr +3; Dex +0; Con +1; Int -1; Wis +0; Cha +0\nSkills Athletics +5, Intimidate +8, Diplomacy +3, Sense Motive +3\nFeats Cleave, Quick Draw\nLanguages Common\nOther Abilities lay of the land\n\nsquad defiance series armor\n\nSPECIAL ABILITIES\n\nLay of the Land (Ex)\n\nA guard officer can alert other creatures to local customs, traditions, tricks, and suspicious activity, granting a +2 bonus for 24 hours on opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks within the guard officer‚Äôs home area (typically a city, large spaceship, or space station). She can also arrange a meeting with a watch captain.\n\nGuard officer: Actually knows what's going on and is somber about it. Was at the Shard before, got out and now is being transferred back. Will let the players into the cargo hold if they can defeat the Akata. Will give them:\n- 2 tactical batons \n- 3 survival knife\n- 1 assault hammer\n- 2 azimuth laser pistol\n- 1 flame pistol\nVelloro will fight with them.\n\n#### Parts of the ship\n- Cargo hold: Where the PCs start, there is an airlock at the back, seats to strap into, and not much else. leads to the rest of the bottom of the ship. The door is locked currently and very hard to open, but the guard outside will let them out without much pushing\n- 1 guard outside the hold \n- A separate hold with a laser door they cannot open that houses [[Boomerang]]\n- Top part of the ship has a main hull section with not much in it. \n- Back of the ship contains the engine room with the spike drive. It is flooded with metadimensional energies as it propels the ship through the Warp. There are two blast doors (Airlock doors, 4 inch thick, hardiness 35, hit points 160, break DC 40) that can't be opened to it. Opening it would flood the ship with the metadimension, killing everyone instantly and destroying the ship.\n- The front is the cockpit, blocked off by those same blast doors.\n- The left room is a storage room with supplies for the prison. There is a lower security locked door to it. \n\t\t- Locked door has a computer to access and open it. The base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier (so 17 for this one). The computer has a level 1 shock grid countermeasure. Saving DC: 20, Damage: 8D6 (XP: 400)\n\t\t\t- The computer and its surrounding environment are protected by a grid of conductive material that transmits a shock to anyone who fails to access the system. This has two settings: one meant to stun and one meant to kill. Normally, the stun setting happens first, with a warning about lethal force should the intruder make another attempt. The stun setting forces all creatures within 10 feet of the terminal to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The lethal setting affects nearby creatures like the stun setting but also deals electricity damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the computer, allowing a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC, damage dealt, and price all depend upon the rank of the shock grid, as indicated on Table 7‚Äì25: Shock Grids. Each rank added counts as one countermeasure when determining the total number of countermeasures a system can have. Only computers fixed permanently to a floor or similar surface can have shock grids. \n\t- Unlocked boxes have food supplies in them\n\t- In the locked storage boxes they can find (Perception roll for searching/Computer Hack system/Strength check to break them open): \n\t\t- DC 10: \n\t\t\t- 3 batons\n\t\t\t-  5 flare guns\n\t\t\t-  3 Estex suits \n\t\t\t- 2 medpatches \n\t\t\t- 2 manacles\n\t\t\t-  2 personal comm units\n\t\t- DC 15: 2 survival knives,  and 2 azimuth lazer pistol for weapons. 8 Estex suits. 500 meters Cable line, titanium alloy. 4 Medpatches. 2 Flashlights. 10 Manacles. 10 Personal Comm units\n\t\t- DC 18: 1 Lashunta ringwear I, 1 azimuth laser rifle, 1 standard Taclash, 2 Basic Medkit, 1 gulchgun, Reaction cannon, light, NIL grenade launcher, merc\n\t\t- DC 23: 1 thinplate, 1 Kasatha microcord I, 1 tactical crossbolter, 1 Incendiary grenade I, 1 Flamethrower, ifrit-class\n- The right room contains two monsters being transported to the prison. The guards will make a deal with the players to show that they can become important in the prison and allow them access to supplies and not cavity search them if they beat these monsters (2 Akata, CR 2).\n\t- (2) Akata: This hairless blue lion has twin tentacular tails. Dozens more thick tentacles quiver and twitch where its mane should be. Terrifying predators that live in space. Its face is two glowing eyes that constantly change color and a large jawed maw. \n\t\t- XP: 400 each\n\t\t- During Combat Akatas seek to infect as many foes as possible with their parasitic bite.\n\t\t- Morale Akatas fight until destroyed.\n### In the cockpit:\n- 2 guard officer (CR 3, XP 1,600)\n\nXP 800\nHuman soldier\nLN Medium humanoid (human)\nInit +5; Perception +8\n\nDEFENSE\n\nHP 40; EAC 14; KAC 16\nFort +5; Ref +3; Will +4\n\nOFFENSE\n\nSpeed 40 ft.\nMelee carbon steel curve blade +11 (1d10+9 S; critical bleed 1d6; analog)\nRanged tactical acid dart rifle +8 (1d8+3 A\u0026 P; critical corrode 1d4; analog) or incendiary grenade 1 +8 (explode 5 ft., 1d6 F, critical 1d4 burn, DC 12)\nOffensive Abilities gear boost (melee striker), fighting style (blitz)\n\nTACTICS\n\nDuring Combat A guard officer tries to close with any threats, to put them down as quickly as possible.\n\nMorale A guard officer retreats when reduced to 15 HP or fewer.\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nStr +4; Dex +1; Con +2; Int +0; Wis +0; Cha +0\nSkills Athletics +8, Intimidate +13, Diplomacy +8, Sense Motive +8\nFeats Cleave, Quick Draw\nLanguages Common\nOther Abilities lay of the land\nGear carbon steel curve blade, tactical acid dart rifle with 20 darts, incendiary grenades I (2), squad defiance series armor\n\nSPECIAL ABILITIES\n\nLay of the Land (Ex)\n\nA guard officer can alert other creatures to local customs, traditions, tricks, and suspicious activity, granting a +2 bonus for 24 hours on opposed Perception and Sense Motive checks within the guard officer‚Äôs home area (typically a city, large spaceship, or space station). She can also arrange a meeting with a watch captain.\n\nABOUT\n\nGuard officers supervise guards in their duties and respond to major disturbances, using their grim demeanors and skill at arms to quell conflict. They coordinate well in battle with the guards under their command, rounding up troublemakers and preventing their escape.\n\n# Play Part 2: The Shard Escape\n\n### **Description of the prison**\n\nThe Shard is an old installation, a space station that has been in orbit around a black hole for longer than the Federation has existed. The station itself consists of a humungous black obelisk, seemingly made out of a shard of rock rather than metal. Eight rectangular spokes jut out near the center of the obelisk, forming part of a more conventional space station structure ringing the center. A ring surrounds and connects the ends of the cell blocks, and you see the dock you are coming in to land on as you approach.\n\n- *Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Culture or Physical Science):* \n\t- DC: 18\n\t- If they fail: they only know it looks like it isn't being used for its initial purpose and is very old. Maybe Mandate tech? The central shard of the station looks like it is carved from a black glassy rock, not metal or any traditional space building materials.\n\t- If they pass: This is older than the first new space faring civilization known in the Kalipso sector, but doesn't look like Mandate tech. It looks foreign, made by no civilization you are aware of. The black rock seems to shift constantly as if it were a liquid while retaining its shape, it looks like nothing you have ever seen before and gives off an ominous vibe.\n\nWhen they arrive, [[Boomerang]] tells them to meet him in the mess hall as soon as they can. He gives them the EMP and tells them about the gangs. He also mentions that his previous crew were planning to break someone out of here, someone with the codename \"[[Bosch]]\".\n\n## The Gangs of the Shard\n\nThere are two major factions of prisoners inside the Shard. The first group are those who are associated with the Poleus Bloc, generally political prisoners or people who hail from Bloc planets. The other factions consists of most everyone else, terrorists, prisoners, gang members, and anyone imprisoned with no connection to the Bloc. \n\n### The Six Runes\n\n- *Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Culture or Religion):* \n\t- DC: 13\n\t- If they pass: They know that the name of this gang probably comes from the state religion of the Poleus Bloc, which worships the god Eloritu. A god of mysteries and magic, as well as technology and mysticism, his main symbol is the magical six runes. \n\nThis gang is headed by a mystic priest named [[Sven Tavzitro]], an enigmatic priest who is basically at war with the guards of the prison, trying to break out and take over the prison. Working with them Sven will send them to the storage wing to sneak in and get a crate for them. Doing so will allow The Six Runes to attempt a riot, and distract the guards for the escape plan. They also know that several Poleus Bloc political prisoners, specifically scientists, have mysteriously disappeared from the prison and they would appreciate any info the players find on them. \n\n### The other gang\n\nDoesn't have a name, has a working relationship with the guards to try to prevent the escape of the Six Runes in exchange for entertainment (The Fight pit), drugs, food, and other things. When they go to try to get help from this gang,  they will have to prove their worth by fighting in the fight pit. Headed by a human outlaw named [[Kolt]]. Getting in good with them they will lure the guards out to the fight pit where they will let you and might help you get keycard access to the Shard in the center of the prison. \n\n## The fight pit (CR 3 or 4, XP 800-1,200)\n\nFlayer leech (CR 4 XP 1,200) or an Early Stage Barath (CR 2 XP 600) and an assembly ooze (CR 1 XP 400)\n\n## The Storage wing\n\nThere is a trap once they enter the storage wing: CR 1 XP 400 (Laser blast trap, if they trip the sensors near the front of the room a laser turret will pop down and shoot them)\n![[Pasted image 20220402181010.png]]\n\nOnce they deal with the trap they find an old room filled with a bunch of useless electronics and long-term storage. The only useful thing is the crate, they will have to make a Perception Search (DC 15) check to find it in time.  There is also a disused emergency airlock in here. \n\n# The math drive\n\nOnce they make it into the room, they can see the Shard up close. A swirling mass of black that seems to suck in all light from the surroundings while simultaneously appearing shiny like obsidian, you can't quite look at it directly. Whenever you do, your seem to avert your gaze without meaning to. \n\nThere are a couple of Poleus Bloc scientists in here researching the Shard against their will, as the Bloc has the formost scientists on math drive tech. One of them is \n\n- Wisdom saving through to see more of it (DC 15)\n\t- Pass: You are able to concentrate on the obelisk and notice the swirling is actually in the form of numbers and mathematical formulas shifting and solving themselves over and over again across the surface of the rock. \n- *Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Physical Science):* \n\t- DC: 17\n\t- If they pass: This is a humungous math drive, larger than any you have heard about before, and there aren't many in the known galaxy. These drives are the central pieces in the ongoing sector wide cold war, and the Federation appears to have one substantially bigger than the Bloc by the looks of it. The control panel near by also appears to be esoteric tech, not made by the Federation, and seems to be regulating the absolutely massive power this shard must be putting out. \n\nWhen they set off the EMP, the station goes pitch black for a second and they can hear the battle start between the Six Symbols and the Guards. When the emergency lights come on, they can see that the Obelisk is swirling much faster now and a faint red glow is starting to come off of it, and it is getting more intense every moment. When they run down the hallway to the space dock, a guard they won't notice will pass them. \n\n- **Perception check: DC: 15**\n\t- Pass: they notice the guard, but where their face should be you see the same swirling blackness and numbers from the math drive. The next second they are gone.\n\nThey run into the guards at the end of the hallway if they have enough health, with some other prisoners to help (and [[Boomerang]]). After that battle they run to the dock and [[Boomerang]] directs him to his impounded ship. We will make the ship in the next session. They fly out of the station and punch the spike drive. As they fly away, they see a couple other starcraft taking off from the station as the red glow from the Shard becomes blinding for a moment before spikes jut out at every angle from it, piercing the station in dozens of locations and rending metal apart, before the Shard blinks out of existence leaving a broken ring of a space station behind.\n\n# End\n\nWhen they get off of the station, it'll be a surprise that a month has gone by in the rest of the galaxy because they were too close to a black hole.

They hear the sound of several people running towards them at the beginning, from every direction. [[Kolt]] and her gang are the first to run up to them, and surround them on the left and top. [[Kolt]] tells them that they have fucked up and need to go with her. If they don't, they can run to the east cell block and run into [[Sven Tavzitro]]. If they go with her she and her gang will lead them up into the mess hall kitchen as several other prisoners (gang members of hers) will start dragging the bodies off into the showers.\n\n[[Kolt]] will be very put together until they reach the kitchen. Then she will burst out in anger at them and tell them they have fucked up. \n- That guard was placed there as a show of goodwill and good behavior. We don't fuck with them, they won't fuck with us. This accord has been maintained and developed over a very long time, and you all think you can just arrive and the same day kill three guards and this not be a problem for me or for you? You are goddamn idiots and have almost ruined everything I have been working towards for the past year. Fortunately for you, there is still a chance to save this. You will be doing everything I say from here on out, and maybe I will be lenient on you. \n- If not, I know you all have seen the entertainment value. At the very least, we can offer you up as recommence and entertainment for the guards.\n- What I need you to do is convince those wackos in the East wing to stay out of our way today. Once you have done that, come back and report to me. Got it? \n\n- Her plan is to attack the guards when they come out to check on the Math Drive room.\n\nIf they refuse, they will be sent to the fight pits. \n\n## The Six Runes\n\nWhen they walk down the east wing, they will have to make a perception check to find the two hidden Lashunta. They will lead them directly to the cell [[Sven Tavzitro]] is in, who they will find praying over a human witchwarper. A large Vesk will stop them before the door. The human will walk out, and Sven will come out and sit down in front of them on the floor and cross his insect legs.\n\nThis gang is headed by a mystic priest named [[Sven Tavzitro]], an enigmatic priest who is here to find [[Bosch]]. When they go to see Sven, if they go from [[Kolt]] to try to get him to not interfere he will ask if they know what she is planning. It will be hard to convince him to not interfere, because he fears for [[Bosch]]'s life if she gains control. if they do convince him, he will ask them to retrieve data from the storage room on all of the prisoners in the prison from the storage room. If they bring it back to him, or if they break the encryption on it themselves, they will find that there are several prisoners that have been assigned to the maintenance room in the middle of the station, including [[Bosch]].\n\n\n\n### **Description of the prison**\n\nThe Shard is an old installation, a space station that has been in orbit around a black hole for longer than the Federation has existed.

There are a bunch of old storage containers, mechanical parts, and broken down electrical equipment, the only thing that seems operational is a monitor in the middle of the room that casts a faint green light on the opposing wall. The monitor sits right in front of an old emergency airlock. \n\nThere is a trap once they enter the storage wing: CR 1 XP 400 (Laser blast trap, if they trip the sensors near the front of the room a laser turret will pop down and shoot them)\n![[Pasted image 20220402181010.png]]\n\nOnce they deal with the trap they find an old room filled with a bunch of useless electronics and long-term storage. The only useful thing is and old computer.  There is also a disused emergency airlock in here. \n\nThe one operating computer to hack is DC 21. There is a firewall for prisoner information that is DC 23. If they fail once, they will hear a whirring as a giant magnet in the computer starts spinning and three Ferrofluid Ooze's will start to wake up. A warning pops up that repeated unauthorized access attempts will result in depressurization of the cabin. They will have to fail 4 times in a row for that to happen. They will get one more chance before the ooze's start moving towards them. The oozes don't particularly care about them, but they want to eat and destroy the computer. They will fight back though. \n\n# The math drive\n\nIf they bring [[Sven Tavzitro]] back the data, he will make a deal to get into the central room so he can help get [[Bosch]] out. He will offer to take them with him when he escapes (He is lying, he will cast the spell Plane Shift to get him and [[Bosch]] of station) He will allow [[Kolt]] to make a move during the guard switch out, but will attack at some point with you to get into the room. You need to go tell [[Kolt]] that [[Sven Tavzitro]] won't bother her for her to start her riot though. \n\n## Prison riot\n\nIf the talk to [[Boomerang]] first, he will express that he wants to get [[Bosch]] out with them, rather than will [[Sven Tavzitro]] and that he doesn't trust the priest.\n\nThe guards will come out and make a perimeter to the central room. Once they are there, [[Kolt]]'s gang will ambush them. After a minute, [[Sven Tavzitro]]'s gang will rush in as well. They will need to pacify the one guard with the keycard access to get the door to open. They will have to fight one of the guards and one of [[Kolt]]'s men at first.\n\nOnce they make it into the room, they can see the Shard up close. A swirling mass of black that seems to suck in all light from the surroundings while simultaneously appearing shiny like obsidian, you can't quite look at it directly. Whenever you do, your seem to avert your gaze without meaning to. \n\nThere are a couple of Poleus Bloc scientists in here researching the Shard against their will, as the Bloc has the formost scientists on math drive tech. One of them is [[Bosch]].

When they run down the hallway to the space dock, a guard they won't notice will pass them. \n\n- **Perception check: DC: 15**\n\t- Pass: they notice the guard, but where their face should be you see the same swirling blackness and numbers from the math drive. The next second they are gone.\n\nThey run into the guards at the end of the hallway if they have enough health, with some other prisoners to help (and [[Boomerang]]). After that battle they run to the dock and [[Boomerang]] directs him to his impounded ship. We will make the ship in the next session. They fly out of the station and punch the spike drive. As they fly away, they see a couple other starcraft taking off from the station as the red glow from the Shard becomes blinding for a moment before spikes jut out at every angle from it, piercing the station in dozens of locations and rending metal apart, before the Shard blinks out of existence leaving a broken ring of a space station behind.\n\n# Making their starship\n\nWe will build it later, just ask them what they want it to look like for now. The pilot needs to make a maneuver check to avoid hitting debris as they fly out (DC 19), if they fail they take 3 points of hull damage as an asteroid rams into them. \n\n# End\n\nWhen they get off of the station, it'll be a surprise that a month has gone by in the rest of the galaxy because they were too close to a black hole.

The first group are those who are associated with the Poleus Bloc, generally political prisoners or people who hail from Bloc planets. The other factions consists of most everyone else, terrorists, prisoners, gang members, and anyone imprisoned with no connection to the Bloc. \n\n### The Six Runes\n\nThis gang is headed by a mystic priest named [[Sven Tavzitro]], an enigmatic priest who is here to find [[Bosch]]. When they go to see Sven, if they go from [[Kolt]] to try to get him to not interfere he will ask if they know what she is planning. It will be hard to convince him to not interfere, because he fears for [[Bosch]]'s life if she gains control. if they do convince him, he will ask them to retrieve data from the storage room on all of the prisoners in the prison from the storage room. If they bring it back to him, or if they break the encryption on it themselves, they will find that there are several prisoners that have been assigned to the maintenance room in the middle of the station, including [[Bosch]].\n\nThis gang is headed by a mystic priest named [[Sven Tavzitro]], an enigmatic priest who is basically at war with the guards of the prison, trying to break out and take over the prison. Working with them Sven will send them to the storage wing to sneak in and get a crate for them. Doing so will allow The Six Runes to attempt a riot, and distract the guards for the escape plan. They also know that several Poleus Bloc political prisoners, specifically scientists, have mysteriously disappeared from the prison and they would appreciate any info the players find on them. \n\n### The other gang\n\nDoesn't have a name, has a working relationship with the guards to try to prevent the escape of the Six Runes in exchange for entertainment (The Fight pit), drugs, food, and other things. When they go to try to get help from this gang,  they will have to prove their worth by fighting in the fight pit. Headed by a human outlaw named [[Kolt]]. Getting in good with them they will lure the guards out to the fight pit where they will let you and might help you get keycard access to the Shard in the center of the prison. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Preparing for the riot\n\n## Starting the Session\n\n[[Nuros]] will wander off at the beginning of the session as they are walking over to [[Boomerang]]'s informant mumbling something under his breath about preparing for the sanctity of battle.\n\n[[Jean-Pierre]] will be at the discussion with Boomerang's informant, but [[Jean-Pierre]] will decide to stay with [[Boomerang]] to work on some gadgets for the riot.\n\n### Talking to [[Boomerang]]'s informant\n\nYou approach a table with a man sitting by himself tinkering with some electronic device. He has dark skin, a shaved head, and very obvious tattoo of a serpent creature spanning the length of his left arm. He looks up as he notices you all approach and you see a severe and handsome face glance at each one of you before settling on [[Boomerang]]. He nods and opens with \"So Boomerang, this is who you are rolling with now? I heard this whole group got in trouble with [[Kolt]]. Not people I'd be associating with if I were you.\" \n\n\"Now now [[Dresden]] give 'em a chance. We've actually come to ask for some help.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah? And what could I do for you.\"\n\n[[Boomerang]]'s informant is a member of [[Kolt]]'s gang. His name is [[Dresden]]. If they convince him to help him out, he can give them access to 1000 UPBs(Universal Polymer Base) and a small workshop in a cell to craft anything they want. They will have 4 hours, just enough for one person to craft one thing. [[Dresden]] will also offer to introduce them to a brand new prisoner ([[Alexander De Leon]]) who arrived shortly after and may be willing to help them. [[Alexander De Leon]] will be in a cell in Cell Block A. \n\nAt some point [[Boomerang]] will suggest looking over the data they got from the computer in more detail. Can use a Perception or Profession check if the profession has to do with searching through data. He will also ask about the prison guards if they haven't thought of them already. If they search they can find the guards naked in the showers, the other guard is still under the bunk in the other room. \n\nDC 17, can probably take 20 to search through. Bring this up.\n- On a success: Each prisoner entry has a brief description of the prisoner. You notice a pattern to the prisoners assigned to cell block E. A majority of them are scientists from the Poleus Bloc with an emphasis on physics and energy production, but there are a few others that are not. These prisoners appear to all be Solarians, something that is exceedingly rare in this sector. These are marked as \"assigned to containment duty\". \n- They can also find files on each of the PCs, which describes the crimes they committed. \n\nThey can find the two guards they killed in the showers, but they will be stripped and picked clean. The third guard they can find the body of in the cell still and steal their outfit still. \n\nWhen they talk to [[Kolt]] she will be in the fight pit discussing with some of her underlings what the plan is. She will ask for proof that [[Sven Tavzitro]] will not interfere in the riot. \n\n## Prison riot\n\nThe guards will come out and make a perimeter to the central room.\n\n### [[Kolt]]'s plan: \n\nOnce they are there, [[Kolt]]'s gang will ambush them. Two of [[Kolt]]'s men will have taken the outfits from the two guards near the storage room and will have integrated with the guards as they come out and will initiate the ambush. If Kolt is able to get the spike drive to go off, the station will travel to a place with multiple starships surrounding it that are loyal to Kolt. \n\nAfter a minute, [[Sven Tavzitro]]'s gang will rush in as well. They will need to pacify the one guard with the keycard access to get the door to open. They will have to fight one of the guards and one of [[Kolt]]'s men at first.\n\n[[Prison Riot combat encounter]]\n\nOnce they pass through the door into the room, they will feel something similar to what they felt went they passed out and were shunted into the Shard beforehand, except this time it also happens to their physical bodies. `As you step through the doorway into darkness you feel a psychic pull similar to what you felt when the whole station passed out. Once again you feel your mind slip towards the center of the station, only this time your physical body follows. You feel and see the swirling green energy you saw before, but much more intensly this time as it seems to slither through every wrinkle of your brain. You awaken moments later lying on the ground in a room much bigger than you expected to be in.` They pass out and wake up in the Shard room, which has a small almost pocket dimension around it that allows the room to be bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.\n\nThey can see the Shard up close. `A swirling mass of black that seems to suck in all light from the surroundings while simultaneously appearing shiny like obsidian, you can't quite look at it directly. Whenever you do, you seem to avert your gaze without meaning to.`\n\nThere are a couple of Poleus Bloc scientists in here researching the Shard against their will, as the Bloc has the formost scientists on math drive tech. One of them is [[Bosch]]. They are all wearing special goggles to protect against the math drive.\n\n- Wisdom saving through to see more of it (DC 15)\n\t- Pass: You are able to concentrate on the obelisk and notice the swirling is actually in the form of numbers and mathematical formulas shifting and solving themselves over and over again across the surface of the rock. \n\t- Fail: take 1d4 psychic damage and you are dazzled as long as you are in the presence of this rock. as you feel.... something invade your mind. \n- *Recall Knowledge Check for the station (Physical Science):* \n\t- DC: 21\n\t- If they pass: This is a humungous math drive, larger than any you have heard about before, and there aren't many in the known galaxy. These drives are the central pieces in the ongoing sector wide cold war, and the Federation appears to have one substantially bigger than the Bloc by the looks of it. The control panel near by also appears to be esoteric tech, not made by the Federation, and seems to be regulating the absolutely massive power this shard must be putting out. If Demitra passes: she specifically recognizes some of the gear/machinery in the room, it vaguely resembles machines she remembers seeing in her parents workshop when she was small.\n\nIf they touch the math drive, they will feel like their whole body is buzzing with static, as if every part of them had fallen asleep. Although it feels just like unordered static, you could swear the static is screaming at you with an anger you can't fully understand. If they touch it they will need to make a DC 17 Will Save or go on the Wisdom Poison track (Freq: 1/day).\n\n[[Bosch]] will exclaim \"What is going on? Who are all of you?\" He will notice [[Qusari]] and exclaim, his eyes widening \"You are a Solarian? This explains it, you threw off the balance with your presence we need to account for you or we will lose control...\" and trails off murmuring to himself. He will also recognize [[Demitra DeMarco]] if she gets up close to him, as he knew her parents. She can make a straight up Int check (DC 18) to see if she remembers him. If she passes, she recognizes his mustache from when she was very young, her parents had invited him over for dinner and to discuss science things with him one night. He will tell her that he worked with them on engineering new output devices for math drives before he was run out of the Federation and took refuge in the Poleus Bloc. Brilliant minds both of them he will say. \n\n[[Sven Tavzitro]] will immediately go for [[Bosch]]. [[Kolt]] will go for the control panel to hack in and force the station to make a spike jump to a random location. They will both try and stop each other.\n\n[[Prison Riot combat encounter#Prison block E encounter|Shard fight]] \n\nWhen they set off the EMP, they feel a very strange compression as the room compacts and the semi-stable pocket dimension collapses. They need to make a DC 15 constitution save or take 1d6 Bludgeoning (Kinetic) damage. The station goes pitch black for a second. When the emergency lights come on, they can see that the Obelisk is swirling much faster now and a faint red glow is starting to come off of it, and it is getting more intense every moment. When they leave Cell Block E, they will notice everyone who was outside is passed out. They can probably make their way freely to \n\nYou all run down the hallway with carnage everywhere, bodies and blood splattering the whole hallway. As you run down, make a perception check.\n\n- **Perception check: DC: 15**\n\t- Pass: Somehow, maybe because you are all rattled or because of all of the carnage around you, you didn't notice a lone guard still standing until you are basically right on top of him. He is walking casually towards where you came from, but as you take a look you notice where their face should be instead you see the same swirling blackness and numbers from the math drive. The next second they walk past you, and if you turn around they are gone.\n\nAt the end of the hallway, the illusion being cast by a couple of [[Kolt]]'s men has dissipated, however this doesn't matter as you see the guards outside the prison block passed out as well, and the cell block remains open. \n\n After that battle they run to the dock and [[Boomerang]] directs him to an impounded ship. We will make the ship in the next session, for now just ask them what they want the concept of the ship to be and the general look. They fly out of the station and punch the spike drive. [[Boomerang]] has a secret coordinates to a beacon that allows travel directly to the Saritri Pala system. As they fly away, they see a couple other starcraft taking off (or landing if Kolt got the spike drive to go) from the station. After a while, you look back and see the red glow from the Shard becomes blinding for a moment before spikes jut out at every angle from it, piercing the station in dozens of locations and rending metal apart, before the Shard blinks out of existence leaving a broken ring of a space station behind.\n\nIf they are in Kolt's desired outcome: They need to make an evade check DC 14 or take 5d8 damage from a twin laser before getting away. \n\nOnce they jump, they jump to Saritri Pala system, and make their way in system to [[Terminus]]. As they fly there and through the spike jump they have a bit of time to decompress after the escape, allow them to do what they want. Once they exit metaspace, they have an hour or so flight to [[Terminus]]. As they fly they see: `Your recently stolen ship rounds the edge of the yellow star as you fly towards the beacon Boomerang has provided. Anyone on the bridge can see a large green gas giant come into view, with swirling clouds of various shades making up its vibrant surface. A little while later, you see the space station emiting the beacon you have been following: A humungous multi-part installation with several docking ports and bright neon lights blasting the name of the station into the void: Terminus. Your new home. Boomerang directs you to a particular dock, and after discussing with the landing crew for a minute you are allowed to enter. Boomerang them quickly ushers you through a part of the station that appears to be a casino for the ultra rich, and you all stick out like a sore thumb. After pushing you along into a back room, you are finally parked in front of a set of opulent doors that Boomerang dissapears into for a minute. Shortly after, he sticks his head back in and gestures for you all to come in.`\n\n`When you enter you see a light skinned woman in a white tuxedo and a red bowtie with her legs up on a carved wooden table with holoprojectors showing video of what appears to be the entire station. She has dark black hair that has been shaved on one side where a cybernetic implant is obviously seen. She takes her legs down when you walk in and stands up.`\n\n\"So, these are the fine gentlemen and ladies that saved one of my favorite handlers from a Federation maximum security prison. I am honored to meet you. My name is [[Avry Raeyen]], and I am the head of the [[Tiandi]].\"\n\nShe will offer them jobs as contractors for the [[Tiandi]], with [[Boomerang]] as their handler.\n\n# Making their starship\n\nSize options: Small or Medium\n\nTier 2: Build points: 75\n\nThey can build whatever ship they want with their build points.

After letting Boomerang know yesterday that you all have decided to try and wipe your criminal status from the Federation's record, he told you all to meet him in the mess hall to go over the mission. This is where you find yourselves as you meet up one by one. Who arrives to the meeting first and who arrives last?\u003c/mark\u003e \n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #ADCCFFA6;\"\u003eThe mess hall is a fairly spacious area with bench style seating that serves food to the denizens of Terminus who are in a rush, with a couple food stalls that are all mildly unappealing in different ways, but offer a lot of food for cheap. \u003c/mark\u003e \n\n\u003cmark style=\"background: #ADCCFFA6;\"\u003eBoomerang isn't here yet, but as the last of you arrive a short gnoll and a large Nuar approach with trays of food in hand.\u003c/mark\u003e \n\n- \u003cmark style=\"background: #FF5582A6;\"\u003e\"Well what do we have here?

I'd get out while you still can.\"\u003c/mark\u003e \n\nThey'll walk away and sit at a table out of earshot of the crew after this. [[Boomerang]] will come jogging up in a hurry with a large data pad in one hand. Short of breath, he'll say:\n\n- \u003cmark style=\"background: #FF5582A6;\"\u003e\"Sorry I'm late folks I pulled an all nighter getting shit together for this mission. One hell of an undertaking for yall right off the bat.

It is a massive structure built before the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] even existed, by the [[Terran Mandate]]. The majority of it sits underground. I've been able to find two main methods of entry: a small annex that serves as a library for the general public, and another. Apparently the archives are incompletely understood, the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] hires spelunkers to explorers to investigate the lower parts of the archive. Despite them going at this for years, progress seems incremental for some reason.

You walk by stalls of dubious looking food, marketplaces for electronics and weapons you can tell are probably 50% complete junk, and towards one of the hallways shooting out from the center of the ring. Down it, you find a little shop hidden away in a corner with a few markings on the front, written in incredibly poor handwriting \"Welcome yes hello come see Scoots for ur shipping needs\". When you walk in, Amos is unable to fit through the door as it is a tiny shop, but it is shallow enough he can bend down and see the entirety of the inside. There you see a strange blue creature, a blue tapered torso lacking many discernable features like a head or appendages, rolling back and forth on a curved chair like object. The creature greets you excitedly as you enter:\n\n- \"Yes yes come in I am of the pleased to have been meeting you you will be purchasing shipping correct I am Scoots.\"\n- The transponder spoofer is 700 credits\n- At some point: \"Good good Scoots and you become friends you ship yourselves through Scoots now Scoots also lets you talk to Fyre Sindicate for good price I give you my data card.\" And he bumps his desk with his body and a business card falls off of it with his contact info.\n\nAfter that they are good to go.\n\nThey have to make 2 successful piloting/navigation checks to get to [[Svallga]].\n- The first is a DC 15, second is a DC 15. \n\t- If they fail, they need to roll a 1d100 on the failed drift navigation table.\n\t- They will need to refuel on their second jump, costs 500 credits. \n- The time it takes to get to Svallga is 4 days per hex divided by 2, so 12 days. \n\nThe ship shudders out of metadimensional space into the Thorhil sector. A large yellow class G star sits quietly in the middle of the system. Ahead, the second planet from the sun, and your destination, comes into view. Svallga is a temperate planet with two major landmasses separated by large oceans, and from your position you get a good look at the light emanating from multiple large cities dotted across the surface. As the Last Resort burns towards the planet, it doesn't take long though before something else catches your eye: several imposing shapes sitting in high orbit above Svallga. In a minute, you are staring at the largest military fleet in the known sector: the Einsatzflottille Primara. A swarm of corvettes, battleships, and smaller ships surround a colossus of engineering, a massive ship large enough to be a city, the capital ship Omnis Dattelin. In the next moment you are hailed by the Planet's control system:\n\n- \"Greetings transport uhhhhh \"is this right? That's the name? Alright.\" Greetings transport callsign Unmistakable Stench of Failure, this is Svallgan flight control please lower your shields and shut off your thrusters to prepare for a routine scan. Do you copy?\"\n- \"Alright Unmistakable Stench of Failure you are free to land.\"\n\nAs you fly down to the planet, your navigation system leads you to the daytime side, and you fly down over an ocean towards the coast of one of the continents. Pretty soon, you see the city come into view, sitting on an estuary next to the ocean: [[Svallga#Koblenz|Koblenz]]. A modestly large city, housing maybe a million inhabitants, it makes an unmistakable impression. Modern Federation style buildings and skyscrapers dominate a majority of the space, with their sleek glass and steel frames and clean angular faces. However, what draws your attention are the other type of structure nestled between the modern chic throughout the city: ancient buildings of intricate stonework and metal, they stick out strikingly in between the newer construction. Buildings built centuries ago by the Terran Mandate, all are much more ornately designed than the rest of the city. Two of these grab your attention more than others: a massive wall that surrounds a majority of the city, and a massive building sitting on top of a hill next to the shipyards. It has a central building with a tapered roof, with two towers jutting up higher than anything else in the city. It is obviously more ornate than even the other Mandate buildings, with a massive number of buttresses, statues, and other detailing covering its surface.\n\nRight next to it is the shipyard, and the control tower comes on over the comms and directs you to an open spot. You land between two other ships and the engines shutter off. [[Boomerang]] speaks up: \"Alright I think its time to go over our options. We need to find a way into the [[Svallga#Sanctum Bundesarchiv|Sanctum Bundesarchiv]] and have some sort of idea of how to manipulate the data in there to get rid of our criminal status. I have a basic layout of the archives, but something more detailed would probably be good. As I see it, our current objective is information gathering. Anyone got good ideas on where to start? Or just go somewhere in the city and start looking around for info?\"\n\n - Have [[Amos]] make a perception check (DC: 12), and [[Jean-Pierre]] make recall knowledge checks (DC 15)\n\t - If [[Amos]] succeeds: \"Amos, you notice on the map of the city something you haven't seen in quite a while, the symbol of the [[Nchak Ascendancy]], the government of the Trox that you left. The embassy sits in the middle of the city, and is potentially the only connection you have on this planet.\"\n\t - If [[Jean-Pierre]] succeeds: \"You archeologist eye is caught by the Koblenz Historical Society, somewhere that potentially has good information on the older aspects of the city, including the Sanctum Bundesarchiv\"\n\nWherever they go first, have them make a perception check DC 17. If they pass:\n- You all notice as you travel the city that there are some of the people on the street that seem to be taking special interest in you. A glance here, someone following you there. You notice one man in a long coat and hat inconspicuously lift up his datapad a little as he sits on a bench and point it in your direction strangely. You can't tell how many of the people on the street are paying close attention to you, but its more than zero.\n\n## Sanctum Bundesarchiv First visit no plan\n\nNo encounter difficulty. NPCs: Receptionist at the first desk, and official receptionist at the back desk for letting in people to the deeper archives. 2 guards there as well.\n\n## Altenkirchen\n\nYou all head downtown to the Altenkirchen ward of the city, where there is mostly new construction and tall skyscrappers. As head further in, the sun begins to set and the city becomes awash in neon light and night life. You reach the densest part of downtown, and there are people everywhere milling about, going to bars and nightclubs, and generally seeming to have a good time. It seems a little seedy here, but everything that you can see at a glance looks completely above board. What are you all looking about for? Asking questions and things? Give me specifics for what type of information you are looking for, and then we'll roll a Culture check, for gathering information and I will tell you what each of you finds out.\n\n- There is a prominent gang in Koblenz that has been rumored to be searching for a way into the old underground sectors of the city, the ones built by the terran mandate for some reason, and have butted heads with the local law enforcement over it a couple times. \n\nIn Altenkirchen, have them make a perception check. DC 21. If they pass, they notice the three [[Eberswalde]] agents following them. There is another that has a sniper at the end of the road that they can't really see. \n\n### Koblenz Historical Society\n\nYou find it in the Steinweg section of the city, hear the western wall. This section seems more relaxed and residential than the rest of the city, however the buildings are still quite tall. The Society itself is located in one of the old Terran mandate structures, repurposed it seems to serve the Historical societies needs. Through the millennia old doors, which although look like stone from far away now you are up close seems to be made of some type of metal, you find a quiet space with virtually nobody around. There are some plaques and other displays, and in the center of the room appears to be a scaled down model of the city, only how it appeared in the past. Once you walk in, [[Friedrech Muller]] will greet you.\n\nMake a perception check on the model of the city.
